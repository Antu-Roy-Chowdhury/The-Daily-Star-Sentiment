Preliminary investigation into the attempted looting at a Gulshan house reveals that Shakil Ahmed, a former caretaker of the property, was responsible for spreading rumours that Tk 200-300 crore might be stashed inside the house.

A childhood in Bangladesh The guardian of Pakistan's cricket heritage A desire to return to Bangladesh  ","With heightened security in place, some of the key locations within the Nishtar Park Sports Complex, where the renowned stadium stands, were temporarily closed. Despite this, a small group of Bangladeshi journalists, including this reporter, sought an opportunity to visit the iconic PCB Museum, located at the National Cricket Academy. However, the museum appeared to be closed. Hope arrived in the form of Shakeel Khan, a former Pakistani international cricketer and current PCB media official, who promised to facilitate a visit once the scheduled press conference of Pakistan's head coach Aaqib Javed and new T20I captain Salman Ali Agha concluded. True to his word, Shakeel later guided us to the museum and introduced us to Yahya Ghaznavi, the museum's curator. What followed was an unexpected yet deeply personal revelation. Upon learning that we were from Bangladesh, Yahya warmly shared, ""I was in Cumilla during the 1971 war."" Yahya's father was stationed in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) in 1971, serving as an administrator at CMH, Comilla. Following the war, his family returned to Pakistan. However, the memories of his childhood remain vivid. ""There was a small market named Tripura Bazar near our house. I also remember a British-era war cemetery and the river Gomti,"" he reminisced. He fondly spoke about his early years in Comilla, saying, ""I think we stayed there for four or five years. I was very young, maybe eight, but I have fond memories."" Yahya also recalled visiting Kaptai Lake and Sylhet's lush tea gardens, where his father's friend was a tea estate manager. Although cricket had not yet gained significant popularity in East Pakistan, he remembered Bangladesh's sporting culture. ""Football was very popular in Bangladesh back then. I also know about Brojen Das, the first Asian to cross the English Channel. And there were two famous mosques—one named Baitul Mukarram—and a place called Paltan Maidan,"" he added. Now serving as PCB's GM of Archives and Game Education, Yahya has played a key role in curating the PCB Museum, located at the National Cricket Academy in Lahore. During a visit by a small group of Bangladeshi journalists, he shared insights into his work and led them through the museum, which showcases the evolution of Pakistan cricket. ""There are many rare photographs in the museum. I have collected them from different sources. The younger generation prefers colored pictures, so I've placed them alongside black-and-white photos,"" he explained. The highlight of the visit was a special room that remains closed most of the time. With a smile, Yahya announced, ""You will see the best thing in this room."" Inside stood Pakistan's greatest cricketing treasure—the 1992 World Cup trophy, won by Imran Khan's team. The museum also houses the 2009 T20 World Cup trophy, the 2017 Champions Trophy, two U-19 World Cup trophies, and several other accolades that narrate Pakistan cricket's glorious journey. As the visit came to an end, Yahya, now in his 60s, expressed a deep-seated wish. ""I never went back after 1971. Sometimes I think I should return and see the old places. I'm sure things must have changed a lot."" His words carried a sense of longing—a bridge between past and present, cricket and nostalgia, Pakistan and Bangladesh. For Yahya, the museum is more than a collection of artifacts; it is a time capsule of memories—both personal and professional—waiting to be revisited, perhaps one day in Bangladesh, where his journey first began.

Mostakim, the brother of one of the victims, filed the case with Sreepur Police Station, said Zainal Abedin Mondal, officer-in-charge of the police station. The accused include Golzar Hossain, JCD joint convener of Sreepur Government College unit; Maruf Pradhan, a resident of Collegepara and leader of Ward 2 JCD under Sreepur municipality; Mehedi Hasan from Lohagachh village; and Md Hridoy from Lohagachh village. Additionally, 20-30 unidentified individuals have been accused in the case. The incident occurred around 9:00pm last night at Sreepur Government Pilot High School. According to the case statement, voter list update activities took place at the school from morning to evening. Due to the large crowd, authorities maintained order by making people queue for services. Mujahidul Islam, the younger brother of a local named Mostakim, was in line to take a photo when he allegedly found out that the accused individuals were charging Tk 200-300 per person to facilitate alternative registration. Informed by his brother, Mostakim and his friends arrived at the scene and protested. This reportedly angered the accused, who then abducted Mujahidul and took him to a secluded spot near the school, where he was severely beaten. He was also stabbed, leaving him bloodied. Locals intervened, prompting the attackers to flee, leaving Mujahidul behind. He was later rescued and admitted to Sreepur Upazila Health Complex for treatment. Speaking to The Daily Star this morning, Mamun Akand, convener of Sreepur JCD said, ""There was an altercation involving Golzar and some students. I have informed the district leadership. We need to determine who is at fault. If any JCD member is found guilty, organisational action will be taken."" Legal action will be taken following an investigation, The OC added.

A mob of over 100 people stormed a house in Dhaka's Gulshan past Tuesday midnight, claiming that it belonged to Tanvir Imam, the son of HT Imam, who was an adviser to the ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina.  ","Abdul Mannan, the caretaker of the house, has filed a complaint, which is currently under process, Mokhlesur Rahman, inspector (investigation) of Gulshan Police Station, told The Daily Star. He further stated that three individuals have been detained in this connection so far. The inspector also clarified that the house does not belong to HT Imam or his son. The daughter of the house owner had divorced Tanvir around 20-25 years ago, the police official said. The live footage broadcast on news outlets shows that intruders, identifying themselves as local residents, carried out a ""search"" of the premises on information that a large cache of illegal weapons and cash were hidden inside and people involved in killing student protesters were holed up there. As the crowd gathered near the house near Shahabuddin Park close to the diplomatic enclave at the heart of Dhaka's upscale neighbourhood, journalists and Youtubers followed soon afterwards. Some of the intruders said they called the media personnel to carry out the search. They chanted anti-Awami League slogans, creating panic in the area. At one stage, they broke open the door of the house. The mob then ransacked wardrobes, shoe boxes, lockers, trolley bags and beds inside the house and searched every nook and cranny. The entire incident was broadcast live by TV stations. On information, the police arrived at the scene but apparently took no action. Later, army personnel rushed there and intercepted the mob. Later, the intruders were allowed to leave the house after law enforcers recorded their addresses and other details. Before leaving the house, the intruders were saying that they did not get illegal firearms, cash or any accused in the cases filed following the killing during mass uprising. During the live telecast, one of the youths, who identified himself as Shakil Ahmed, told reporters ""We are local residents and entered the house to search whether any illegal firearms or money was hidden."" When a journalist asked whether they have any permission to carry out such a search, he said, ""We carried out the search on our own ."" Shakil said they had reported the matter to law enforcers but they did not take any action. Talking to reporters, caretaker Mannan said the house does not belong to HT Imam or his family. The house was owned by one Rahman, who was Tanvir's former father-in-law. The couple was divorced long ago, possibly in 2001. Mannan said the people broke the door and entered the house.

7,St Martin's Island: Tourism curb sparks ecological revival,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/tourism-curb-sparks-ecological-revival-3839751, ,"Abdul Aziz, a resident of St Martin's Island in Teknaf upazila of Cox's Bazar, was on a morning walk along the island's southern shoreline when he noticed a thick layer of snail and oyster shells deposited along the coastal kaya trees. In recent days, the number of snails and oysters washing ashore has visibly increased. ""These changes might be happening because the island has remained undisturbed for over a month after the tourist season ended,"" said Aziz, an environmental activist. Speaking to locals, it was learned that the island's biodiversity is undergoing a remarkable restoration. A layer of snail and oyster shells has sedimented along the shoreline, the number of turtles arriving to lay eggs has increased, and mangrove forests in different parts of the island are flourishing as human and vehicular movement has significantly declined. Local resident Joynal Abedin said a mangrove forest is emerging over more than an acre of rocky coastline in the island's southern region, including Diyar Matha. Md Jamir Uddin, deputy director of the Department of Environment's (DoE) Cox's Bazar office, said with tourist activities and battery-powered vehicles restricted, at least seven to eight kilometres of beach along the island's southeast and west have seen an accumulation of seashells. These shells help prevent beach erosion and protect the island's dunes. Previously, locals collected and sold these shells to traders who used them to make showpieces and jewellery. He said drones were used to locate waste deposits, leading to the collection of over 930 kilogrammes of waste in a cleanup operation that began on February 12. Around 90 percent of the waste consisted of chips packets, polythene bags, and biscuit wrappers. He said the number of Olive Ridley turtles coming to the island to lay eggs is rising, as artificial lights and loudspeakers -- major deterrents for turtles -- have been restricted. Authorities are also protecting the turtles and their eggs from stray dogs that previously attacked them. Various studies have identified 1,076 species of biodiversity on St Martin's, including corals, seaweed, turtles, shellfish, marine fish, birds, mammals, and crabs. The island's sandy shores are a critical nesting site for endangered turtles. However, unregulated infrastructure development, excessive tourism, and environmental pollution have put the island's ecosystem at risk. To protect the island, authorities set a deadline of January 31 for tourist visits this year, allowing only 2,000 visitors per day for two months. In previous years, the island remained open for tourists from October to April, with over 5,000 visitors arriving daily. Due to unchecked tourism, the island's biodiversity was being destroyed, said environmental activists. Tourists roamed every corner of the island on battery-run vehicles or motorbikes, which damaged the beach and mangrove forests. They also took away snail and oyster shells. Last year, conservationists collected around 1,400 turtle eggs from 13 turtles. This breeding season, they have already collected 2,500 eggs from 19 turtles. Over 160 eggs have hatched, and the baby turtles have been released into the sea. In 1999, the DoE declared St Martin's an Ecologically Critical Area. On January 4, 2023, the environment ministry designated 1,743 square kilometres of the Bay of Bengal adjacent to St Martin's as a Marine Protected Area. However, Habibur Rahman, a former member of St Martin's Union Parishad, said some marginalised people are breaking corals into small pieces to sell as construction materials. Local people and hoteliers are buying these stones. ""They are doing this because their income has dropped significantly due to the restrictions on tourism,"" he said. Despite the tourism curbs, many locals continue fishing, drying fish for trade, and cultivating vegetables and watermelons for their livelihoods.

However, unregulated infrastructure development, excessive tourism, and environmental pollution have put the island's ecosystem at risk. To protect the island, authorities set a deadline of January 31 for tourist visits this year, allowing only 2,000 visitors per day for two months. In previous years, the island remained open for tourists from October to April, with over 5,000 visitors arriving daily. Due to unchecked tourism, the island's biodiversity was being destroyed, said environmental activists. Tourists roamed every corner of the island on battery-run vehicles or motorbikes, which damaged the beach and mangrove forests. They also took away snail and oyster shells. Last year, conservationists collected around 1,400 turtle eggs from 13 turtles. This breeding season, they have already collected 2,500 eggs from 19 turtles. Over 160 eggs have hatched, and the baby turtles have been released into the sea. In 1999, the DoE declared St Martin's an Ecologically Critical Area. On January 4, 2023, the environment ministry designated 1,743 square kilometres of the Bay of Bengal adjacent to St Martin's as a Marine Protected Area. However, Habibur Rahman, a former member of St Martin's Union Parishad, said some marginalised people are breaking corals into small pieces to sell as construction materials. Local people and hoteliers are buying these stones. ""They are doing this because their income has dropped significantly due to the restrictions on tourism,"" he said. Despite the tourism curbs, many locals continue fishing, drying fish for trade, and cultivating vegetables and watermelons for their livelihoods. মঙ্গলবার মার্কিন কংগ্রেসে দেওয়া বক্তব্যে জেলেনস্কির কাছ থেকে পাওয়া চিঠি পড়ে শোনান ট্রাম্প।"

Investigations into alleged corruption Managing refugee crisis In an interview with Sky News, Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus said that ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina will stand trial for crimes against humanity. Investigations into alleged corruption Managing refugee crisis  ","""A trial will be taking place. Not only her, but also all the people who are associated with her - her family members, her clients or associates,"" Yunus said at the interview published today. Hasina is accused of overseeing a system of enforced disappearances during her time in office, as well as for the mass killing of protesters in July and August of the previous year, the Sky News mentioned. Hasina, who was toppled by the protests on August 5 and is currently in exile in India, is accused of overseeing a network of secret detention centres where it's alleged her political opponents were interrogated, tortured and some killed - all under the banner of a ""war on terror"". Bangladesh tribunal has issued two arrest warrants for her. Bangladesh had sent ""formal letters"" but received ""no official response"" from New Delhi, Yunus said. However, he insisted that Hasina would face the court, whether physically present in Bangladesh or in absentia, in India. Yunus recently visited one of the now ""infamous secret jails"", code-named the 'House of Mirrors'. ""This is just the ugliest thing that you can see, you can feel, or you can observe,"" he said. Yunus said the number and range of people involved in the alleged crimes was ""taking time"" to work through. ""Everybody was involved in it all,"" he said. ""The whole government was involved in it. So, you cannot distinguish who was really and enthusiastically doing it, who was doing it under orders and who was not quite supportive but carrying out those kinds of things."" Hasina, the military and police are also accused of a violent crackdown on protesters in July and August which the UN estimates killed as many as 1,400 people in the days before the former prime minister fled. Yunus tried to manage expectations around how quickly the families of victims will see justice, and whether that will happen under his watch. ""Some will get punished, some will still be under the process, some will still be untraceable,"" he said. The chief adviser has had a large in-tray to deal with since taking over a country in turmoil, including anti-corruption probes into those connected to Hasina. British Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who is Hasina's niece, is one of those being investigated by the country's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC). Yunus said the case against her was ""serious"", that she had a large amount of ""wealth left behind"" in the country and ""everything"" would be looked at. Siddiq resigned as anti-corruption minister in January after being named in the investigation in Bangladesh. A spokesperson for the London MP said she ""totally denies the claims"" and had ""not been contacted on these matters"". The influx of Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh is another challenge for the Yunus-led interim government. There's been a sharp rise in the number of the mainly Muslim minority fleeing Myanmar into Bangladesh after escalating violence in the country's long-running civil war. Yunus said they were now in talks with ""rebel groups"" in Myanmar about the possibility of a ""safe zone"" to eventually help the Rohingya refugees to return to their homeland. He also acknowledged big problems in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar, home to the largest refugee camp in the world, where an estimated one million Rohingya refugees have fled to - and where ""violence, drugs and paramilitary activities"" are rife. The tension, Yunus said, ""will not disappear"". ""A trial will be taking place. Not only her, but also all the people who are associated with her - her family members, her clients or associates,"" Yunus said at the interview published today.

10,Bangladeshis burdened with high internet taxes,https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/bangladeshis-burdened-high-internet-taxes-3839831,"Bangladeshi citizens were burdened with some of the highest taxes on internet usage in Asia in 2024, with a combined tax rate of 39 percent on internet services, according to a recent report by GSMA, a non-profit organisation that represents the interests of mobile network operators worldwide. Bangladeshi citizens were burdened with some of the highest taxes on internet usage in Asia in 2024, with a combined tax rate of 39 percent on internet services, according to a recent report by GSMA, a non-profit organisation that represents the interests of mobile network operators worldwide.  ","This high tax rate, comprising 21 percent in sector-specific taxes and 18 percent in VAT, exacerbates the digital divide and poses a significant barrier to the country's digital transformation efforts, the report said. The report, titled ""Enabling Mobile Network Investment: Policy Reforms for Bangladesh"", reveals that Bangladesh's internet tax rate far exceeds that of its regional peers. Nepal imposes a 26 percent tax on internet services, Sri Lanka 23 percent, India 18 percent, the Philippines 12 percent, and Indonesia 11 percent. The GSMA report highlights that the telecom sector in Bangladesh faces additional financial challenges, including notably higher corporate income tax rates compared to other industries. Publicly traded telecom companies are taxed at 40 percent, while non-publicly traded companies face a 45 percent rate—higher than rates in India and comparable to those applied to industries like tobacco. Furthermore, telecom operators are subject to a minimum turnover tax of 2 percent, significantly higher than the 0.6 percent applied to other sectors. The lack of a credit mechanism for input taxes further increases operational costs, reducing profitability for telecom operators. For instance, operators incur an additional 7.5 percent cost because the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission does not register them for VAT. The report underscores that Bangladesh stands at a critical juncture in its journey towards becoming a trillion-dollar economy and achieving developed nation status. The telecom sector, as a vital enabler of this transformation, is expected to drive economic growth, foster innovation, and ensure digital inclusion. However, achieving these goals will require substantial investments in telecom infrastructure, which are currently hindered by high taxes and regulatory challenges. Key obstacles identified in the report include a complex licensing framework that increases administrative burdens, restrictions on infrastructure ownership and sharing that create inefficiencies, and short licence durations that complicate long-term investment planning. Additionally, opaque penalties, retrospective audits, and prescriptive regulations create uncertainty for investors and limit market-driven growth. To address these challenges, the GSMA recommended creating an attractive business environment by streamlining licensing processes, extending licence periods, and allowing mobile operators to deploy their own infrastructure. It also suggests reforming the fiscal framework by reducing sector-specific taxes, aligning corporate taxes with other industries, and introducing transparent tax policies. Establishing a progressive regulatory framework with market-driven regulations and improving transparency is another key recommendation. Finally, the report calls for government enablers for investment, including regulatory stability, fiscal support, and prioritised digitalisation initiatives. The report emphasises the need for collaboration among government bodies, telecom operators, and investors to build a future-ready telecom ecosystem. ""By addressing these challenges and implementing these reforms, Bangladesh can unlock the full potential of its telecom sector, ensuring it becomes a cornerstone of the nation's journey to a developed and digitally inclusive economy,"" the report concludes.

11,"Bangladesh doesn’t need IMF funds, but right policies: governor",https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/bangladesh-doesnt-need-imf-funds-right-policies-governor-3839836,"Bangladesh does not need funds from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) if it can mobilise enough domestic resources, said Bangladesh Bank Governor Ahsan H Mansur, as he stressed that the country requires the right policies rather than ""begging for foreign funds"". Bangladesh does not need funds from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) if it can mobilise enough domestic resources, said Bangladesh Bank Governor Ahsan H Mansur, as he stressed that the country requires the right policies rather than ""begging for foreign funds"".  ","""Bangladesh's financial position is strong. The only weak area is revenue collection, and the solution lies in improving revenue generation,"" Mansur said at a roundtable yesterday. ""This fiscal year, the country has nearly $29 billion in remittances and $50 billion in exports. These two sources alone contribute about $80 billion. After deducting letters of credit (LCs), the country still has $10 billion in hand,"" the central bank governor said at a roundtable organised by The Business Standard at its office at Eskaton in Dhaka. ""Why should I have to go and beg for money?"" Speaking at the event titled ""Path to Recovery for the Banking Sector"", Mansur said, ""I still publicly say that we don't need IMF money, but we do need the right policies. If our policies are correct, we won't need foreign funds; we can manage with our own resources."" He pointed out that despite rising interest rates, deposit growth remains sluggish. The banking sector's ultimate solution lies in increasing deposits. ""To resolve non-performing loans (NPLs), deposit growth must be high, and that will happen only with good governance. When there are enough deposits, it becomes easier to tackle other banking sector issues,"" said Mansur, an economist who served the IMF earlier in his career.  He said the Bangladesh Bank will soon conduct a fit and proper test for bank directors to assess their suitability. ""If found unfit, they will be asked to resign."" ""We don't want to see housewives, daughters and sons on boards who have no proper experience."" The governor said the central bank will also form a panel of independent directors so that banks can appoint them. The government has sought suggestions from the Association of Bankers, Bangladesh (ABB) on the qualifications required for directors. ""The central bank will not allow the country's exchange rate to be dictated by Dubai or any other external market,"" he said. ""That is not acceptable."" ""The central bank will determine the exchange rate pragmatically, considering the country's needs and economic conditions. If necessary, it will devalue the local currency in a structured manner,"" said the governor. ""Let that be absolutely clear to transactors and aggregators."" Agent banking is thriving and 50 percent of agents will have to be women, he said, adding that a circular on this will be issued soon as part of financial inclusion efforts. He believes agent banking may overtake traditional banking due to its growing popularity. Meanwhile, the central bank is taking steps to promote QR code payments to further financial inclusion. On recovery of laundered assets, Mansur said, ""All we can hope for is to secure judgments at home and send them abroad with attachments to properties there."" Repatriating wealth takes time, but countries like Nigeria, Malaysia, and Angola have successfully done so, he further said. ""We hope the next political government will continue the effort to recover assets -- a process we have already initiated. Civil society can exert pressure on political parties to maintain the momentum,"" added the governor. A five-year reform agenda cannot be completed in a year or 18 months. The current government will push as much as possible following the international standards, and the next government must carry it forward, Mansur commented. As the tax-to-GDP ratio remains low, the government is borrowing from banks, while high NPLs are straining liquidity, said Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director and CEO of Mutual Trust Bank. On the NPL crisis, he cited weak governance, inadequate central bank supervision and the absence of a level playing field. Rahman said law and order needs to be improved and a stable energy supply for industries must be ensured. Selim RF Hussain, managing director and CEO of BRAC Bank, said banking regulations have become overly complex and should be liberalised. He also urged aligning the NPL definition with international standards so that banks cannot conceal bad loans. Ali Reza Iftekhar, managing director & CEO of Eastern Bank Limited, said the banking sector suffers from weak corporate governance at the board level. He called for regulatory improvements to meet international benchmarks. Banks with capital and provisioning shortfalls should have a clear roadmap to address these issues, he added. Other speakers at the event included Mashrur Arefin, managing director & CEO of City Bank; Sohail R. K. Hussain, president & managing director of Bank Asia PLC; Sharif Zahir, chairman of United Commercial Bank PLC (UCB); Mohammad Abdul Mannan, chairman of First Security Islami Bank PLC; Md Obayed Ullah Al Masud, chairman of Islami Bank; and Mati ul Hasan, managing director of Mercantile Bank.

They were brought out of the detention cell wearing helmets, bulletproof jackets, and handcuffs. However, their handcuffs and helmets were removed when they were placed in the dock. At 10:15am, when the judge took the bench, hearings began to show them as arrested in various cases. Later, the court granted the arrest petitions for each of them one by one. After that, they were taken from the court to the prison holding area. Before and after being presented in court today, some of the accused spoke briefly with journalists. At that time, a journalist asked Shajahan Khan how he was doing. In response, he said, ""I am here with your prayers. Pray for me."" The journalist then asked, ""What should we pray for?"" In response, Shajahan Khan said, ""Pray that I am released soon so that I can work towards restoring peace and order in the country and participate in the upcoming election."" The journalist then remarked, ""Everyone is saying that you have ruined the country."" To this, Shajahan Khan responded, ""It will soon be proven whether we ruined the country or someone else did."" As he was being taken back to the prison holding area after the hearing, another journalist asked him why he smiled so much. Shajahan Khan replied, ""I always smile. I will keep smiling until my last breath."" When asked how he was doing in prison, he said, ""I am doing very well. I am safe from terrorists while in prison."" During today's hearing, at one point, Farzana Rupa sought permission from the court to speak. Addressing the court, she said, ""I do not have a lawyer to speak on my behalf. May I speak in favour of my bail?"" The judge responded, ""This is a hearing to show you as arrested, not a bail hearing."" Farzana Rupa then said, ""The number of cases is piling up. I am a journalist. A single murder case is enough to frame me."" Later, Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Md. Monirul Islam showed her as arrested in the case whose hearing was ongoing. While standing in the dock, Farzana engaged in a long conversation with her husband and fellow inmate Shakil Ahmed. After being placed in the dock, Solaiman Selim called a lawyer and started discussing various matters. During the conversation, the lawyer asked him how life was in prison. Solaiman Selim replied, ""I am fasting. I read books. I can talk to my family over the phone. The food during Sehri and Iftar is normal. Don't you see how everyone's faces look drained?"" Shortly after, the judge entered the courtroom. However, Solaiman Selim continued speaking. Addressing journalists, he said, ""Many journalists publish fake news. They wrote that Shajahan Khan and others are getting good food in prison. These false reports are making our situation worse."" At this point, police officers instructed him not to speak while standing in the dock. In response, Solaiman Selim said to them, ""You are going to slaughter me anyway. Give me a little time."" He then expressed his frustration to the lawyer, saying, ""A death sentence could be handed down at any moment. I wouldn't be surprised. Look at how Bangabandhu's house was demolished. The message is clear."" After the hearing, when Solaiman Selim was being taken to the detention cell, he called another lawyer and inquired about his father's health. He asked for updates as his father was unwell. As he was being led away, a journalist asked him about his comment regarding a possible death sentence. He replied, ""Justice is not rushed."" He was then taken to the detention cell. Meanwhile, Kamal Ahmed Mojumder was seen today being helped into the dock by the police. During the hearing, he leaned against the dock's wall and did not engage in much conversation with anyone.

I am a journalist. A single murder case is enough to frame me."" Later, Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Md. Monirul Islam showed her as arrested in the case whose hearing was ongoing. While standing in the dock, Farzana engaged in a long conversation with her husband and fellow inmate Shakil Ahmed. After being placed in the dock, Solaiman Selim called a lawyer and started discussing various matters. During the conversation, the lawyer asked him how life was in prison. Solaiman Selim replied, ""I am fasting. I read books. I can talk to my family over the phone. The food during Sehri and Iftar is normal. Don't you see how everyone's faces look drained?"" Shortly after, the judge entered the courtroom. However, Solaiman Selim continued speaking. Addressing journalists, he said, ""Many journalists publish fake news. They wrote that Shajahan Khan and others are getting good food in prison. These false reports are making our situation worse."" At this point, police officers instructed him not to speak while standing in the dock. In response, Solaiman Selim said to them, ""You are going to slaughter me anyway. Give me a little time."" He then expressed his frustration to the lawyer, saying, ""A death sentence could be handed down at any moment. I wouldn't be surprised. Look at how Bangabandhu's house was demolished. The message is clear."" After the hearing, when Solaiman Selim was being taken to the detention cell, he called another lawyer and inquired about his father's health. He asked for updates as his father was unwell. As he was being led away, a journalist asked him about his comment regarding a possible death sentence. He replied, ""Justice is not rushed."" He was then taken to the detention cell. Meanwhile, Kamal Ahmed Mojumder was seen today being helped into the dock by the police. During the hearing, he leaned against the dock's wall and did not engage in much conversation with anyone. মঙ্গলবার মার্কিন কংগ্রেসে দেওয়া বক্তব্যে জেলেনস্কির কাছ থেকে পাওয়া চিঠি পড়ে শোনান ট্রাম্প।"

Speaking to journalists at the Secretariat this morning, Wahiduddin said, ""While the new books were supposed to be delivered by February, many students are still waiting."" However, he assured that the issue would be resolved by the new deadline. Addressing concerns over recent unrest in public and private educational institutions across the country, he said, ""It can't be said that the situation has fully returned to normal, but it has improved to some extent."" Wahiduddin also spoke about financial challenges in the education sector, noting that 15 years of deprivation could not be addressed in a single year's budget. ""It is not possible to allocate all the funds for pensions and welfare benefits within this year's budget.

15,Exports edge up in further relief to economy,https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/exports-edge-further-relief-economy-3839841,"Bangladesh's exports have shown resilience, displaying steady growth in key sectors such as garments, plastics and seafood in the first eight months of fiscal year (FY) 2024-25, somewhat defying global economic headwinds and domestic concerns like high inflation and political uncertainty. Bangladesh's exports have shown resilience, displaying steady growth in key sectors such as garments, plastics and seafood in the first eight months of fiscal year (FY) 2024-25, somewhat defying global economic headwinds and domestic concerns like high inflation and political uncertainty.  ","In February, export earnings stood at $3.97 billion, a 2.77 percent year-on-year increase from $3.86 billion, according to data published by the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) yesterday. This development comes days after the Bangladesh Bank reported a jump in remittance inflows, which surged 25 percent year-on-year to $2.52 billion last month, offering much-needed relief to a strained economy. Total exports in the first eight months of FY25 reached $32.94 billion, up 10.5 percent year-on-year. Exports of the readymade garment (RMG) sector, Bangladesh's largest export earner, grew 1.66 percent last month. Overall, apparel exports rose 10.64 percent to $26.79 billion in the July-February period compared to the preceding year. In the same period, knitwear exports climbed 11.01 percent to $14.34 billion, while exports of woven garments increased 10.22 percent to $12.45 billion. The RMG sector accounted for over 81 percent of total export earnings, yet again underlining its dominance in the country's export basket. ""The outlook of our garment exports is promising as work orders are rebounding,"" said Faruque Hassan, a former president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA). However, he said law and order must be improved as international clothing retailers frequently raise concerns over security. According to Hassan, the country is also benefiting from US President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Higher tariffs on Chinese and Mexican apparel exports to the US are redirecting orders to Bangladeshi manufacturers, he opined. However, low pricing remains a key challenge, he mentioned. Manufactured goods, which make up the bulk of exports, saw a 10.49 percent increase to $31.87 billion in the first eight months of the fiscal year. Key segments such as plastic products, rubber and headgear posted strong growth of 22.25 percent, 34.71 percent and 11.40 percent, respectively. Leather and leather products showed mixed results. While total exports in this category rose 8.48 percent to $757.50 million, raw leather exports fell 8.68 percent. In contrast, leather footwear exports surged 24.02 percent to $450.88 million, showing a shift towards higher-value products. The engineering sector recorded a 7.48 percent rise, led by electric products and bicycle exports, which grew by 13.51 percent and 64.7 percent, respectively. Specialised textiles, including knitted and woven fabrics, also saw strong growth, increasing 21.62 percent. Terry towel exports grew by just 3.11 percent in the first seven months but plunged 41 percent in February to $1.5 million from $2.54 million a year earlier. M Shahadat Hossain Sohel, chairman of the Bangladesh Terry Towel and Linen Manufacturers and Exporters Association, linked the sector's declining competitiveness to rising production costs driven by increased gas and power prices and higher wages. He said that corruption at customs, including bribes during raw material imports and product shipments, has further complicated the situation. ""Without immediate reforms and a reduction in production costs, the sector may struggle to remain competitive in international markets,"" Sohel commented. RN Paul, managing director of RFL Group, said strong performance in the plastics sector was driven by export orders from new destinations. Previously reliant on European markets, the industry has recently expanded to North America, Australia and parts of Africa. Paul said RFL registered export growth of 35 percent in the past eight months and anticipates further expansion, particularly with the addition of new products such as toys. Commenting on the export figures, Selim Raihan, executive director of the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling, expressed mixed sentiments. The economist said that the sustainability of export growth remains uncertain due to challenges such as stagnant private investment, high inflation and security concerns. The upcoming general election adds to the macroeconomic uncertainty, he noted. Still, Raihan said the export growth figures are encouraging although the earnings largely came from previous orders.

Dhaka has topped the list of cities with the worst air quality with an AQI index of 304 at 09:04am today.  ,"The air was classified as ""hazardous"", according to the air quality and pollution city ranking. An AQI between 151 and 200 is considered ""unhealthy"" while 201-300 is ""very unhealthy"" and 301-400 is considered ""hazardous"", posing severe health risks to residents. China's Beijing, Uzbekistan's Tashkent and Iraq's Baghdad occupied the second, third and fourth spots in the list, with AQI scores of 238, 220 and 179, respectively. The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. The AQI in Bangladesh is based on five pollutants: particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and ozone. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon. As per World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, mainly due to increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections.

Many wealthy countries and developing nations exposed to climate impacts wanted an accelerated timetable, arguing the reports would allow countries to be guided by the most up-to-date science. But they faced objections from some oil producers and major polluters with rising emissions, such as India and China. The talks in Hangzhou ran over by more than a day, wrapping up late Saturday night with an agreement to allow work to proceed without a definitive deadline for delivery.

The deadlock ""only serves those who wish to hold back climate action, but climate vulnerable countries cannot wait"", Yao said. ""It's a bitter disappointment every time when division leads to a decision being postponed or kicked down the road."" The meeting was overshadowed by a US decision to stay away, as President Donald Trump unpicks his predecessor's climate actions.

""International scientific progress is key to prosperity, equity, and resilience -- for the US and all nations,"" said leading climate scientist Johan Rockstrom, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.

29,Khan Jahan Ali and his lasting legacy in Bagerhat,https://www.thedailystar.net/environment/natural-resources/news/khan-jahan-ali-and-his-lasting-legacy-bagerhat-3836196,"""The mosque city of Bagerhat"", now a Unesco World Heritage Site in southern Bangladesh, owes much of its cultural and architectural heritage to the legacy of Khan Jahan Ali (R), a revered Sufi saint and administrator of 15th-century Bengal. ""The mosque city of Bagerhat"", now a Unesco World Heritage Site in southern Bangladesh, owes much of its cultural and architectural heritage to the legacy of Khan Jahan Ali (R), a revered Sufi saint and administrator of 15th-century Bengal.  ","After arriving in Bengal during the reign of Sultan Mahmud Shah of the Bengal Sultanate, he was given the official title of Khan-i-Azam of Khalifatabad, now Bagerhat, with a forest area within the Sundarbans as his ""jagir"". Over the years, he transformed the forested land into a centre of Islamic architecture and history, drawing visitors and historians from around the world. Khan Jahan Ali (R) played a key role in spreading Islam in the region. His legacy endures through the mosques, water reservoirs, and settlements he built, blending spirituality with practicality to serve the local community. His architectural contributions include numerous mosques, with legend attributing around 360 to him, though only a handful remain today. The Sixty Dome Mosque, or Shat Gombuj Masjid, stands out as the finest example. Built in the 15th century with bricks, stones, and terracotta motifs, it is the largest mosque in Bangladesh. Despite its name, it features 77 domes and four smaller domes supported by 60 columns. ""This mosque is not just a place of worship but a testimony to the engineering brilliance of its time,"" said Muhammad Jayed, custodian of the Bagerhat Museum. Another notable structure is the Nine Dome Mosque, or Noy Gombuj Masjid, near the shrine of Khan Jahan Ali (R), which showcases intricate brickwork and a fusion of local and Islamic architectural styles. Recognising the importance of water management in the deltaic region, Khan Jahan Ali constructed large reservoirs, known as dighis, including Ghoradighi, Thakurdighi, and Poncha. These reservoirs provided water for locals and became symbols of sustainability and foresight. Thakurdighi, adjacent to his mausoleum, is one of the largest and most beautiful dighis he built. Regarded as sacred by locals, it attracts visitors who offer prayers. ""Khan Jahan Ali's vision ensured that even today, people benefit from these dighis,"" said Hasina Begum, a local resident. He was also a pioneer in establishing a self-sufficient community. His strategic planning included roads and settlements to facilitate trade and communication, said Md Ariful Islam, executive director of the Khan Jahan Welfare Foundation. His tomb, near the Dargahdighi, remains a historical site and a place of pilgrimage. Today, Bagerhat stands as a testament to his wisdom, faith, and commitment to humanity. After arriving in Bengal during the reign of Sultan Mahmud Shah of the Bengal Sultanate, he was given the official title of Khan-i-Azam of Khalifatabad, now Bagerhat, with a forest area within the Sundarbans as his ""jagir"". Over the years, he transformed the forested land into a centre of Islamic architecture and history, drawing visitors and historians from around the world. Khan Jahan Ali (R) played a key role in spreading Islam in the region. His legacy endures through the mosques, water reservoirs, and settlements he built, blending spirituality with practicality to serve the local community. His architectural contributions include numerous mosques, with legend attributing around 360 to him, though only a handful remain today. The Sixty Dome Mosque, or Shat Gombuj Masjid, stands out as the finest example. Built in the 15th century with bricks, stones, and terracotta motifs, it is the largest mosque in Bangladesh. Despite its name, it features 77 domes and four smaller domes supported by 60 columns. ""This mosque is not just a place of worship but a testimony to the engineering brilliance of its time,"" said Muhammad Jayed, custodian of the Bagerhat Museum. Another notable structure is the Nine Dome Mosque, or Noy Gombuj Masjid, near the shrine of Khan Jahan Ali (R), which showcases intricate brickwork and a fusion of local and Islamic architectural styles. Recognising the importance of water management in the deltaic region, Khan Jahan Ali constructed large reservoirs, known as dighis, including Ghoradighi, Thakurdighi, and Poncha. These reservoirs provided water for locals and became symbols of sustainability and foresight. Thakurdighi, adjacent to his mausoleum, is one of the largest and most beautiful dighis he built. Regarded as sacred by locals, it attracts visitors who offer prayers. ""Khan Jahan Ali's vision ensured that even today, people benefit from these dighis,"" said Hasina Begum, a local resident. He was also a pioneer in establishing a self-sufficient community. His strategic planning included roads and settlements to facilitate trade and communication, said Md Ariful Islam, executive director of the Khan Jahan Welfare Foundation. His tomb, near the Dargahdighi, remains a historical site and a place of pilgrimage. Today, Bagerhat stands as a testament to his wisdom, faith, and commitment to humanity. মঙ্গলবার মার্কিন কংগ্রেসে দেওয়া বক্তব্যে জেলেনস্কির কাছ থেকে পাওয়া চিঠি পড়ে শোনান ট্রাম্প।"

31,Our gentle giants in peril,https://www.thedailystar.net/environment/wild-life/news/our-gentle-giants-peril-3838251,"Over the past decade, nearly half of the country's wild elephant population has been wiped out. WOES OF THE WILD WHY THIS CONFLICT AND WHAT CAN BE DONE Over the past decade, nearly half of the country's wild elephant population has been wiped out. WOES OF THE WILD WHY THIS CONFLICT AND WHAT CAN BE DONE  ","These gentle giants, which once roamed freely across Bangladesh's lush forests, have been falling victim to human-elephant conflict, driven by relentless deforestation and habitat loss. In the last 10 years, at least 124 wild elephants were killed across Cox's Bazar, Chattogram, the Chittagong Hill Tracts, and Mymensingh regions. Many fell prey to retaliatory killings, electrocution, poaching, and train accidents. Conversely, 83 people have also been killed in elephant encounters during this period. Yet, the government's response has been limited, with few visible actions to prevent further losses. According to a 2016 survey by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), there were only 457 elephants in the country, including 268 wild elephants, 93 migratory elephants, and 96 in captivity. The study found that from 2003 to 2015 (13 years), 63 wild elephants were killed, clearly indicating that the rate of elephant killings has doubled in the last decade. However, it was not determined how many of the recorded deaths involved migratory elephants. Meanwhile, a circus elephant died in Lalmonirhat in 2019 due to extreme stress, while a captive elephant calf was killed after being hit by a train in Uttara, Dhaka, in 2023. 
 With Bangladesh's forests disappearing at an alarming rate, conservationists fear these magnificent creatures may soon vanish from the country altogether. According to data from the Wildlife Management and Nature Conservation Division (WMNCD) under the forest department, at least 102 wild elephants were killed in the Chattogram region alone in the past decade (2016-Jan 2025). Data obtained by The Daily Star showed that 16 died from electrocution, while five were shot dead. The Wildlife Division reported that 53 elephants died from ""old-age complications"" or ""natural causes"" such as heart failure. At least 17 died from accidents, while the causes of the remaining deaths could not be determined. During this period, 44 people died in human-elephant conflicts in the region. Conservationists, however, argue that all the elephant deaths resulted from human intervention. Despite the scale of the crisis, only 18 cases have been filed for the killing of elephants. One such incident involved Ali Akbar, a 36-year-old welder from Chattogram's Karnaphuli upazila. One night, upon stepping out of his home, he encountered an elephant nearby. Fearing it might trample his home and family, he attempted to chase it away, triggering the animal's ""fight or flight"" instinct. Within moments, Akbar was crushed to death. ""He was the sole breadwinner of the family… His death has left us in turmoil,"" said Akbar's wife, Minu Akter. Over the past six years (2019-2024), such incidents in Chattogram have claimed 44 lives, left at least 33 injured, and destroyed the property of 382 families. The Wildlife Division attributes these encounters to habitat destruction and food shortages, which force wild elephants into human settlements. ""Deforestation, hill-cutting, and industrial expansion are driving elephants out of their habitats and into human settlements,"" said Abu Naser Md Yasin Newaz, divisional forest officer of the Wildlife Management and Nature Conservation Division in Chattogram. Meanwhile, 22 elephants and 39 people have died in human-elephant conflicts in the Mymensingh region since 2016, said ANM Abdul Wadud, divisional forest officer in Mymensingh. Three cases were filed with Nalitabari and Jhenaigati police stations in 2023 and 2024 regarding the deaths of three elephants. Additionally, a total of seven general diaries were filed with different police stations over elephant deaths, Wadud said. According to forest department sources, elephant deaths were recorded as follows: four each in 2016 and 2017, three in 2018, one in 2019, two in 2020, two in 2021, three in 2022, two in 2023, and one in 2024. MA Aziz, a professor of zoology at Jahangirnagar University who has dedicated his career to studying elephants, warned that wild elephants are currently the most vulnerable species in Bangladesh. ""An elephant needs around 200-250kg of vegetation and 150 litres of water daily. But their habitats can no longer provide these… So, they wander into human settlements, desperately looking for food. And that's where tragedy strikes."" Bangladesh has never launched a long-term conservation initiative for elephants, he said. ""If the government does not take immediate action, Bangladesh may no longer be one of the 13 Asian countries with wild elephants within the next decade."" Simanta Dipu, programme manager at IUCN, said, ""In 2016, the IUCN recorded only 457 elephants in Bangladesh. A century ago, these creatures roamed freely across the country's forests."" Human settlements, agricultural lands, roads, highways, brickfields, and village markets have developed within or near elephant movement routes and corridors, exacerbating human-elephant conflicts, he said. Amir Hossain Chowdhury, chief conservator of forests (CCF), admitted that most elephant deaths occur due to human-elephant conflicts. Of the 12 elephant corridors that once existed, one in Ramu and two in Teknaf have already been completely closed. An elephant corridor is a narrow strip of land that allows elephants to move between habitats without human interference. ""We need to involve local communities to save these elephants,"" Amir said, adding, ""We've submitted a project proposal to the Planning Commission for elephant conservation."" The proposed ""Elephant Conservation Project,"" if approved, will be Bangladesh's first government-funded elephant conservation initiative since independence. Under it, the forest department will conduct an elephant census in 2026 to estimate the remaining elephant population. With a budget of Tk 41 crore, the three-year pilot project aims to support elephant response teams with funding and logistics, raise public awareness, and install solar fencing to prevent elephants from straying into human settlements. Solar fencing, which delivers a harmless shock, is expected to deter elephants while protecting villages from destruction. Currently, farmers set up illegal electric fences to keep elephants away from their farmlands, leading to fatal consequences for the animals. To address this, the conservation project also plans to ensure that affected farmers receive compensation for crop damage, aiming to reduce hostility towards elephants. Speaking to The Daily Star yesterday, Environment Adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan, said, ""The situation has reached a alarming level as we've destroyed almost all the elephant corridors. Elephants have the habit of using the same routes they're familiar with. ""With the involvement of experts and different organisations, we've already resolved the human-elephant conflict issue in the KEPZ [Korean Export Processing Zone] area [in Chattogram's Anowara]."" Regarding the elephant conservation project, she said it is expected to be approved by the Planning Commission by the end of March. ""Under the project, a certain area of the Gazipur Safari Park will be assigned to rehabilitate captive elephants. We'll also protect the remaining elephant corridors and form elephant response teams in different areas.""

A poignant tale that revolves around the protagonist Sakhina's husband who is martyred in the 1952 Language Movement, Ahmed's work captures simultaneously the heartbreak and the pride of losing a loved one for the greater, collective political aspiration of a people. As Sakhina mourns the death of her beloved, her father urges her to take pride in his sacrifice—a dualism that characterises Bangladesh's struggle for independence.  
 Published on the first anniversary of 21st February, this short story collection features stories, such as Shawkat Osman's ""Mouno Noy"", Nur Ul Alam's ""Ekaler Rupkatha"", Rabeya Khatun's ""Prothom Boddhobhumi"", Shahidullah Kaisar's ""Emni Korei Gore Uthbe"", among others. Set against the backdrop of the tumultuous days of February 1952, this collection offers snippets of quotidian Bangali lives as the struggle for independence and linguistic autonomy raged on.  On the occasion of this year's Ekushey Boi Mela, book lovers have much to look forward to. From thought-provoking short stories and captivating novels to powerful poetry and engaging plays, the fair offers a diverse selection catering to all literary tastes.  
 Brought to this year's Boi Mela by Oitijjhya Prokashoni, in her debut poetry collection, Syeda Nilima Dola traces her evolution as a poet, capturing the raw emotions and transformative moments that have shaped her journey. Much like the title of her book, she finds the intensity of her love for life through poetry. In Mofossholio Intensity, she explores the experiences that shape our psyche and the intensity of emotions that moves us to find solitude in art. With an achingly beautiful tribute to all the people she loves, this book explores the theme that we are just a mosaic of everyone and everything we have ever loved. 
 Selina Hossain is a widely celebrated Bangladeshi fiction writer who sheds light on society's taboos through activism in her writing. Her book, Hijra Shobdokosh, is another significant addition to her literary works, published in 2019 by Somoy Prokashon. This book provides detailed information on the language, culture, and various aspects of the lives of the Hijra community. It highlights the scrutiny and misconceptions surrounding the Bangladeshi Hijra community and the generational mistreatment that they have lived through. It inspires conversation on how we can practise open-mindedness and recognise the struggle such marginalised communities face in cementing their identity in this society. Encouraging their social inclusion, it urges readers to see the Hijra community as an equal and respected minority while emphasising the importance of accepting their existence.  
 Each year, innumerable Bangla translations of international bestsellers inundate the shelves at Boi Mela, making them accessible to a wider readership in Bangladesh. At this year's fair, we think Tripti Santra's translation of The White Book is one worth checking out. Originally written by Han Kang, a South Korean writer, The White Book is a deeply personal semi-autobiographical account that immerses readers into the severity of losing a loved one and the confusion of perceiving the world in their absence. Kang first rose to international prominence for her novel The Vegetarian, which became the first Korean language novel to win the International Booker Prize for fiction in 2016. In 2024, she became the first Asian woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, which the Swedish Academy awarded Kang for her ""intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life"".

34,"Lawachhara forest: Vanishing streams, dying wildlife",https://www.thedailystar.net/environment/natural-resources/news/lawachhara-forest-vanishing-streams-dying-wildlife-3837861,"Once a vibrant and ecologically rich haven, Lawachhara Forest in Moulvibazar is now facing a dire environmental crisis. Decades of unchecked deforestation and severe water shortages have led to a decline in forest density, putting its wildlife at grave risk. Once a vibrant and ecologically rich haven, Lawachhara Forest in Moulvibazar is now facing a dire environmental crisis. Decades of unchecked deforestation and severe water shortages have led to a decline in forest density, putting its wildlife at grave risk.  ","The lush, diverse canopy that once flourished has dwindled, leaving behind a fragile ecosystem where both flora and fauna are struggling to survive. As the forest's vital resources disappear, the future of one of Bangladesh's most important national parks hangs in the balance. Just a decade and a half ago, the streams, canals, and reservoirs within the forest retained water even during the dry season, said Saju Marchiang, a resident of Lawachhara punjee. ""Now, however, these vital water sources have dried up, leaving the forest's wildlife in an increasingly desperate situation. The ongoing loss of natural trees and the depletion of water resources have exacerbated the drinking water crisis for animals, forcing them to leave the forest in search of food and water, often resulting in fatalities,"" he added. According to the Forest Department, 222 wild animals were rescued in Srimangal, Moulvibazar last year. Of them, 104 were found dead. Alongside the Forest Department, two organisations -- Bangladesh Banya Prani Sheba Foundation and Stand for Our Endangered Wildlife (SEW) -- have played a key role in rescuing wild animals. Sohel Shyam, a founder of SEW, said forest density has significantly declined in recent years. The old, valuable trees that once defined Lawachhara have been uprooted. As the canals and streams dry up during the dry season, the drinking water crisis for wildlife is worsening, forcing animals into local communities in search of sustenance, he added. Swapan Deb Sajal, director of Bangladesh Banya Prani Sheba Foundation, said most animal rescues occur in areas surrounding Lawachhara, especially during the dry season. Nurul Mohaimin Milton, general secretary of the Bangladesh Environmental Journalists Association, Moulvibazar unit, said multiple factors have contributed to the forest's deterioration. These include tree smuggling, the Magurchhara gas well accident, infrastructure developments such as railways and roads cutting through the forest, the expansion of lemon and pineapple orchards, the growth of tourist centres, and an increasing number of visitors. Gidison Prodhan Suchiang, headman of the Magurchhara Khasi Punjee, an area within the forest's boundaries, said, ""Just 15 years ago, streams and canals retained water even during the dry season. Now, they have dried up. The cutting of trees is one of the primary causes."" According to the Wildlife Management and Nature Conservation Department, Lawachhara Forest has been a protected area since the Assam government designated 1,250 hectares of West Bhanugach in Kamalganj as a protected forest in 1917. Further protections were added in 1923 and 1925 for the Kalachara and Chautali areas. In 1996, Lawachhara was designated a national park. The park is home to 460 rare species of plants and animals, including 167 plant species, four amphibian species, six reptile species, 246 bird species, and 20 mammal species. However, former Lawachhara range officer Shahidul Islam said the forest, as it existed 35 years ago, is no longer the same. He said wildlife, including snakes and other animals, is increasingly venturing into local communities due to the severe shortage of food and water. Md Jahangir Alam, divisional forest officer, said wildlife is leaving the forest in search of food and water. Plans are in place to address the water shortage, including the construction of reservoirs in Lawachhara. Although some lakes still hold water, it is insufficient to meet the needs of wildlife, he said, adding that efforts are being made to improve the situation.

Further protections were added in 1923 and 1925 for the Kalachara and Chautali areas. In 1996, Lawachhara was designated a national park. The park is home to 460 rare species of plants and animals, including 167 plant species, four amphibian species, six reptile species, 246 bird species, and 20 mammal species. However, former Lawachhara range officer Shahidul Islam said the forest, as it existed 35 years ago, is no longer the same. He said wildlife, including snakes and other animals, is increasingly venturing into local communities due to the severe shortage of food and water. Md Jahangir Alam, divisional forest officer, said wildlife is leaving the forest in search of food and water. Plans are in place to address the water shortage, including the construction of reservoirs in Lawachhara. Although some lakes still hold water, it is insufficient to meet the needs of wildlife, he said, adding that efforts are being made to improve the situation. মঙ্গলবার মার্কিন কংগ্রেসে দেওয়া বক্তব্যে জেলেনস্কির কাছ থেকে পাওয়া চিঠি পড়ে শোনান ট্রাম্প।"

36,Personalistic authoritarianism and Bangladesh: Reading Ali Riaz’s ‘Ami E Rashtro’,https://www.thedailystar.net/culture/books/news/personalistic-authoritarianism-and-bangladesh-reading-ali-riazs-ami-e-rashtro-3828806,Sadman Ahmed Siam Sadman Ahmed Siam  ,"Bangladesh has suffered the terrible luck of having to deal with authoritarianism several times since its inception, most recently under the Awami League from 2009 to 2024. Bangladesh is not alone, as the global trend at present seems to be sliding towards authoritarianism. These civilian-authoritarian regimes have fundamental differences with the brutal dictatorships of the past, which has forced citizens fighting for democracy to change their methods of protest. Ali Riaz, a prominent political scientist, lays out these discussions for general readers in his short book, Ami E Rashtro: Bangladesh E Byaktitantrik Shoirotontro. The book has seven chapters in total, where the first four are an attempt to situate the authoritarian regimes in a global context, and the final three deal with Bangladesh specifically. Ami E Rashtro begins with a brief introduction to personalistic authoritarianism, with examples such as Russia, China, and North Korea—where authoritarianism is not based on total brute force, but rather a cult of personality. The data Riaz presents illustrates how there is now a global trend towards authoritarianism, which has reversed the democratic wave that started in the 70s and continued after the Cold War ended. The author analyses what could have led to this reversal. Academics have identified three types of causes—economic, politico-institutional, and social. The economic reasons involve economic decline and inequality which exists between the citizens of the country. Politico-institutional reasons refer to the weakening of institutions which are supposed to safeguard democracies, such as the judiciary, human rights, and anti-corruption organisations, etc. by political elites, and breakdown of the rule of law. Finally, the social reasons involve clashes between different ethnic or religious groups and class divisions in society. Although these are integral to explaining the rise of authoritarianism, Riaz explains that what differentiates them from previous ones is the inclusion of another crucial element—ideology. Ideology, or a national story/myth is needed to legitimise all the shortcomings of the economy and the political system. The new authoritarians don't want to be seen as applying brute force in a military style; instead, they want to be perceived as democratic. This is why they utter phrases such as ""democracy customised to local culture and heritage"", which is nothing but a refusal to follow international standards. Riaz also expands upon the process by which an authoritarian regime executes its will—democracy itself. By creating an ideological grounding, the would-be authoritarian claims to be the saviour of the nation and wins the parliament through majority votes. Then they weaken the legislature, change laws in their favour, and attack their political opponents through legal and ideological frameworks, portraying them as enemies to the nation's sovereignty. In other words, these regimes use democracy to undermine democracy. The chief discussion of the book revolves around personalistic authoritarianism, a special variant of today's authoritarian regimes. In this form, the ideological framework posits the leader and their family as the supreme, above everything else in the nation, eventually creating a cult of personality. Another feature of personalistic authoritarianism is patrimonialism—the tendency to use state property as personal belongings. These behaviours include but aren't limited to nominating family members for the highest rank in different national organisations, acquitting them of criminal charges without proper investigation, and granting them property bypassing the law. The rule of order breaks down in this system, and the only way to ensure that a citizen can attain anything is their connection to the ruling authority. Processes become irrelevant, and institutions are made impotent. Riaz reiterates the history of Bangladesh and its three authoritarian regimes, including the two non-military dictatorships in 1972-1975 and 2009-2024 and the military dictatorship of 1975-1990. He explains how Bangladesh can be a case study to test academic theories on authoritarianism. Issues with the formation of the constitution in 1972 are discussed, including how it put several restrictions on fundamental human rights such as freedom of speech. These articles were later used to legislate laws to crush dissent and opposition. In addition, the constitution put too much power in the hands of the prime minister and made them virtually above the law, which certainly eased the way into building a personalistic dictatorship—where one person's command is enough to overturn everything. These were justified with an ideology which placed Sheikh Hasina and her family as the sole leaders of the Liberation War in 1971. Critics were silenced and anyone opposed to the regime was called 'anti-Liberation War', 'traitor', and 'threats to sovereignty'. The Sheikh family practically reigned over the country, which resembles the patrimonialism described by Riaz earlier. The Sheikh family and their members took decisions in the government bypassing existing laws and processes; here, Riaz gives an example of Adani's deal with Hasina, which was made solely by Sheikh Hasina despite continuous criticism from experts. The final chapter discusses how to get out of such a situation. Riaz outlines a few solutions, such as strengthening the institutions which are to protect the democratic structure, such as the judiciary, human rights and anti-corruption agencies, the election commission, etc. He also suggests reforming the constitution to add checks and balances so that no one person has unmatched power—be it the president or the prime minister—and a change in political culture itself by ensuring democracy inside political parties and organisations first. The July Uprising in 2024 has given Bangladesh new hope, and this time, citizens are demanding substantial change so that Bangladesh does not find itself face to face with another dictatorship. This book is a vital resource for achieving that goal, by analysing previous mistakes and formulating new pathways.

37,The space for indigeneity:  Discussing ‘Ethnicity and Adivasi Identity in Bangladesh’,https://www.thedailystar.net/books-literature/news/the-space-indigeneity-discussing-ethnicity-and-adivasi-identity-bangladesh-3825021, ,"The recognition of indigenous citizens and their rights has been a point of contention in Bangladeshi politics for quite some time. It gained more traction after August 5, once Sheikh Hasina was ousted and the hope for a new Bangladesh where all ethnic and religious identities would live with dignity was reignited. This served as the backdrop for the book talk on Ethnicity and Adivasi Identity In Bangladesh by Mahmudul H Sumon, which was held at DrikPath Bhobon on February 8, 2025. The discussion panel included the author himself and journalist Saydia Gulrukh. The talk commenced with Saydia Gulrukh introducing the book, which has gained renewed relevance in the present as the subject of indigenous rights sparked nationwide discussion. She talked about the modern state and the conspiratorial role it assigns to groups of people it marks as ""enemies"", providing examples of the Bawm people facing systemic subjugation under that conspiratorial narrative. She expanded on how the new political establishment seems to exclude indigenous citizens not only in violent ways, such as the attack on indigenous activists on January 15, but also in non-violent ways, such as reform commissions not actively engaging with indigenous people. Following her introduction, author Mahmudul H Sumon discussed indigenous activism, which he categorised as a type of ""politics of recognition"" that can be traced back to the 90s. He shared his own experiences of getting to know indigenous activists during this period and observing how the movement for indigenous recognition took shape. He realised that academic discussions surrounding indigenous people often took a much more romantic and aestheticised tone, which was both unhelpful and ahistorical. Therefore, he wanted to theorise and historicise it, focusing on how previous colonialism and its view of indigenous people affected them. He also wanted to look into how indigenous activists are reclaiming their own heritage and history through their work. According to the author, Ethnicity and Adivasi Identity In Bangladesh is about all indigenous people in Bangladesh, whether they resided in the plain or the hills. Afterwards, the author elaborated on the book's five chapters and what each dealt with. Discussing the first chapter, which is about transnational governmentality and adivasi subjectivity, Mahmudul H Sumon dove into what he called the ""transnational discourse of indigeneity""—how indigenous activism sprang up worldwide and how the global movement has affected debates about indigeneity, colonisation, land dispossession, etc., transcending national borders. Anthropological studies have both shaped and been shaped by this discourse. The second chapter deals with the colonial archive and its effects, covering topics such as the CHT Manual enacted in the British period and how it protected the hill tracts at that time. He also brought up the systemic dispossession of indigenous communities such as the Garo from Madhupur and Shalban, which is an often neglected issue in indigenous discourse. The reclamation of the identity of Adivasi as their own forms the basis of the third chapter. This includes debates surrounding the recognition of Adivasi or indigenous identity under the clauses 107 and 169 of ILO, which grants a certain set of special privileges to the community, including the protection of their habitat and customs. The fourth focuses on a very specific festival as a part of this reclamation—Wanna or Wangala, which has seen a revival through activism in recent times. The final chapter poses a heavy question: Do Adivasis exist? Despite the misconception many Bangalis hold about the word, and repeated denials of Adivasi identity on a national stage (such as when former Foreign Minister Dipu Moni said that Adivasis don't exist in Bangladesh), the author concluded that Adivasis do, in fact, exist. This conversation recalled the previous discussion on the transnational discourse of indigeneity. Next, Sumon emphasised the role of the government in finding solutions to these problems, and pointed out that the government has, so far, been reluctant to initiate or enter a dialogue on the issue. He mentioned that the denial of indigenous identity and rights has only strengthened the movement more. Bangali nationalism was also discussed, considering its role in the subjugation of indigenous peoples in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. After this session, the floor was opened to the audience for questions. Questions ranged from the lack of female and working class activists in the formation of Bangali identity, to the geopolitical reasons which are often brought up to justify denying recognition to indigenous people. The lack of indigenous people in the discussion panel was also questioned, and both Gulrukh and Sumon expressed that this was a limitation on their part. The questions surrounding indigenous citizens continue to be complex, as do their answers. It can get easier, but until the state volunteers to come forward and have a meaningful and genuine conversation, progress will not be possible. Discussions such as these are important steps in getting there, and it must include more representatives from indigenous communities themselves. It is hoped that their struggles will pay off in a post-July Bangladesh, which held the principles of equality and justice as its leading force.

38,"Desire, Identity, and the boundaries of silence",https://www.thedailystar.net/books-literature/news/desire-identity-and-the-boundaries-silence-3825026,Namrata Namrata  ,"Saikat Majumdar, a professor of English and Creative Writing at Ashoka University, is a writer whose works delve deep into the intricacies of identity, desire, and the tensions between personal yearnings and institutional expectations.  With novels such as  ,  , and  , Majumdar has established himself as a unique voice in contemporary Indian literature. A seasoned writer and academic, Majumdar's literary trajectory is marked by a continuous exploration of human longing, repression, and the complex interplay between the self and societal structures. His previous works, such as   also published as   in the U.S. and  , further illuminate his distinctive voice, weaving together intricate psychological landscapes with critical commentaries on class, culture, and the human condition.  His exploration of human experiences in spaces defined by silence, repression, and societal constraints challenges traditional narratives, offering readers a profound reflection on the complexities of selfhood and the struggle for authenticity. This piece unpacks the recurring themes in Majumdar's writing, examining how his characters navigate the delicate interplay between desire, identity, and institutional pressures. In  , Majumdar's hallmark narrative approach emerges clearly: a sensitive, lyrical engagement with the inner lives of his characters, whose desires and vulnerabilities often clash with the cultural and institutional structures around them. Much like in his earlier works, Majumdar uses settings that are not merely backdrops but almost characters in their own right. Whether in the suffocating, monastic world of   or the theatre-focused realm of  , his settings are carefully crafted to reflect both the outward constraints of society and the internal struggles of the protagonists. These characters often find themselves caught in systems that demand conformity—be it the monastic discipline of   or the rigid structures of performance and fame in  . This tension between individuality and socialization is a recurring theme in Majumdar's writing, shaping the lives of his characters in ways both subtle and powerful. In Saikat Majumdar's works, themes of desire, identity, and alienation persistently take center stage, offering a layered and nuanced exploration of the human condition.  In  , the protagonist's life is an intricate dance between his pursuit of personal artistic fulfillment and the oppressive societal forces that demand conformity. Majumdar delves into the tension between the artist's creative desires and the constraining expectations imposed by the institutions that seek to shape his art. This internal conflict is not merely personal; it is deeply tied to the broader societal norms and pressures that dictate who one should be. Majumdar's portrayal of the artist's struggle is one of yearning—an attempt to carve out an authentic identity within a world that demands adherence to conventional norms. This thematic exploration of selfhood is not only a reflection of individual longing but also an examination of the dissonance between the private and public selves.  In  , these themes of desire and identity are amplified and complicated within the context of religious and monastic life. The protagonist, Anirvan, is drawn to the serenity and discipline of monastic life, hoping to achieve purity and spiritual enlightenment. Yet, his monastic aspirations are continually thwarted by his profound emotional and physical attraction to another person, Kajol. This conflict between spiritual aspiration and earthly desire reflects a deeper struggle within Anirvan's identity. While the monastic order professes celibacy and purity, Anirvan's desires—quiet, yet undeniable—force him to confront the contradictions of the very space he has chosen for transcendence. His journey becomes not just one of spiritual enlightenment but also one of grappling with the tensions between the self he is taught to be and the self he cannot deny. Majumdar's treatment of religious communities in   echoes the same questions explored in The Firebird, though this time with a sharper focus on the limitations and contradictions inherent in the structures meant to guide moral and spiritual lives.  Both novels probe the ways in which systems—be it art institutions or monastic orders—create spaces for individuals to form their identities, but these spaces are often fraught with tension. In the case of  , the artist's identity is formed and constrained by the expectations of society, while in  , Anirvan's identity is shaped by the monastic vow of celibacy, even as he struggles against the desires that threaten to disrupt it. Majumdar's works poignantly explore the tension between institutionalized ideals and human desires, illustrating the ways in which institutions—whether artistic, religious, or societal—attempt to control, shape, and suppress natural human yearnings.  In   the monastic community represents an extreme form of this control, wherein the vow of celibacy and spiritual discipline are intended to purify the body and mind. However, Majumdar reveals that human desires—particularly the intimate and sensual—are not so easily suppressed. The characters within this monastic world are forced to reckon with their own desires, which do not simply vanish in the face of doctrinal rigidity. Instead, they manifest in ways that complicate and destabilize the characters' sense of self. Anirvan, the protagonist, is torn between the monastic ideals he seeks to embody and the deep, human longing for connection that he experiences in his relationship with Kajol. This tension between ideal and reality—between the purity of spiritual practice and the fullness of human emotion—drives the narrative, revealing that attempts to control or eliminate desire often lead to inner turmoil rather than peace.  Majumdar suggests that desire is not a simple force to be eradicated or ignored, but an integral part of identity that informs who we are. The characters in  cannot fully suppress their longings, and as they try to reconcile their desires with the monastic discipline they have chosen, they experience profound internal conflict. This conflict extends beyond mere sexual or romantic desires and speaks to a broader struggle between personal authenticity and the external pressures of institutional expectations. Majumdar's exploration of this internal dissonance reveals that desires—whether they are related to love, passion, or simply the yearning for a deeper connection with oneself—are inextricably bound to our sense of self. When these desires are repressed or misunderstood by institutional frameworks, they can distort a person's sense of who they are and how they fit into the world around them.  explores the artist's struggle to reconcile personal ambition and societal expectations similarly underscores Majumdar's central theme: the tension between personal desires and external pressures. The artist in   seeks creative authenticity, yet finds himself ensnared by the rigid structures of the art world, which demand conformity and subordination. Here, the internal conflict is not just about artistic expression but about the very act of self-definition—how one's identity is shaped by forces both external and internal. Like the monks in  , the artist must contend with the limitations placed on him by the institutional forces that define what is ""acceptable"" or ""worthy."" Majumdar deftly shows that the repression of personal desires—whether artistic, emotional, or otherwise—often results in alienation.  The characters in both novels are forced to navigate their yearning for authenticity in environments that stifle individuality in favor of conformity. The alienation that arises from this conflict is a central theme in Majumdar's work, one that reflects the broader societal reality where individuals often find themselves at odds with the expectations placed upon them. In both   and  , the characters' struggles are emblematic of the wider human experience of yearning for a true sense of self in the face of external impositions. These institutional spaces—the monastery in   and the art world in  —attempt to channel and mold the desires of their members, but in doing so, they inadvertently create spaces of profound alienation. The characters' inability to fully reconcile their inner selves with the roles they are expected to play leads them to question their identities, their desires, and the very systems that try to define them.  Majumdar's works ultimately ask us to consider the consequences of attempting to suppress or distort human nature to fit external ideals. In a world where institutions—be they artistic, religious, or societal—seek to impose rigid boundaries on human desire and identity, Majumdar challenges the notion that self-fulfillment can be achieved by adhering to external expectations. His characters' journeys are not just about seeking love or artistic expression but about trying to carve out a space for personal authenticity in a world that often values conformity over individuality. Through these struggles, Majumdar paints a complex portrait of human identity—one that is never fully harmonious, but always evolving, conflicted, and profoundly human.  Moreover, Majumdar has a unique way of layering his novels with socio-political undertones. In  , the cloistered world of the boarding school, isolated from the outside world, is gradually pierced by the outside forces of political tension, social inequalities, and the rawness of human survival. Similarly,   interrogates the world of art and theatre, offering a critique of performance as both a form of expression and a mechanism of control. These works are grounded in a keen awareness of the larger socio-political world that influences and shapes the personal lives of the characters. In  , his most recent work, Majumdar continues to explore the internal landscape of identity, but with a sharper focus on the body—both its materiality and its symbolic significance. This shift suggests an ongoing deepening of his engagement with the notion of selfhood and its construction in relation to both individual and collective experiences. It is this gradual expansion of his thematic scope—moving from the psychological to the corporeal—that marks Majumdar's evolution as a writer.  The consistency across Majumdar's works lies in his ability to create complex, multi-dimensional characters caught in the throes of societal expectations, personal desire, and the yearning for self-understanding. His writing is marked by a lyrical elegance that belies the emotional and psychological complexity of his characters. His subtle exploration of taboo subjects—such as same-sex love in   or the intersection of class and personal desire in  —invites readers into a reflective space where these hidden truths come to the forefront. At the heart of Saikat Majumdar's literary oeuvre lies a profound examination of identity—how it is shaped, constrained, and ultimately defined by the tension between individual desires and the institutional forces that seek to control them. His characters often find themselves navigating spaces where their personal truths are at odds with the expectations of society, be it within religious orders, artistic institutions, or broader cultural frameworks.  stands as a quintessential example of this thematic exploration, offering a narrative that is richly textured, emotionally resonant, and deeply reflective of the complexities inherent in the human condition. In this novel, Majumdar intricately weaves the paradox of yearning and constraint, capturing the beauty and brutality of a world where both personal desires and collective histories are in constant negotiation. The central theme in  —the tension between desire and repression—resonates not only in the context of Anirvan's spiritual journey but also within the broader spectrum of societal and institutional pressures. The monastic life, with its rigorous demands of celibacy, discipline, and silence, represents a space where human longing is both suppressed and intensified. Through the character of Anirvan, Majumdar delves into the complexities of human desire, showing how it cannot be easily erased or suppressed, even in the face of seemingly inviolable spiritual or societal codes. This internal conflict is at the core of Majumdar's exploration of identity—how we seek to define ourselves within the confines of systems that often demand conformity, but also how our desires and truths resist these limitations, emerging in defiance of them.  Majumdar's exploration of identity is never one of easy resolution. His characters often struggle to find a sense of self that is not defined by the external structures surrounding them. In  , Anirvan's journey is emblematic of this ongoing struggle. He is caught between the allure of spiritual purity and the undeniable pull of his emotional and sensual yearnings. This tension—between the desire for transcendence and the reality of human emotion—is a central motif in Majumdar's writing, and it reveals the inherent contradictions within the systems that try to govern personal lives. Majumdar suggests that identity is not a fixed, stable concept, but one that is continually shaped, reshaped, and sometimes shattered by the forces of repression and desire.  What sets Majumdar apart from other contemporary Indian writers is his ability to capture the complexity of human identity in a world that is simultaneously modern, global, and deeply rooted in traditional values. His works, including The Scent of God, challenge the boundaries of the Indian literary canon, pushing the envelope on themes that are often considered taboo or uncomfortable to explore. He does not shy away from depicting the harsh realities of institutional pressures, whether they come in the form of religious celibacy, societal expectations, or cultural norms. Yet, in doing so, Majumdar also illuminates the possibility of personal liberation—the potential for truth and authenticity to emerge even in spaces of silence and repression.  Majumdar's thematic exploration of desire, identity, and institutional pressure is not confined to  . It is a consistent thread that runs through his entire body of work, from  to  , and beyond. In each of these novels, Majumdar's characters are forced to confront the tension between their internal desires and the external forces that seek to define and limit them. This struggle is the beating heart of his writing, and it is what gives his work its emotional resonance and intellectual depth. His narratives do not offer simple answers or resolutions, but rather, they present the complexity of the human experience in all its contradictions.  Majumdar's writing lingers long after the final page, a thread that can be found in all his works. The questions he raises about identity, desire, and repression are not easily forgotten. His ability to craft stories that are both haunting and thought-provoking makes him a unique and powerful voice in contemporary Indian literature.  He challenges his readers to think deeply about the ways in which personal and collective histories intersect, how identity is shaped by both internal and external forces, and how the human longing for authenticity can never be fully constrained by the institutions that seek to govern it. In this sense, Majumdar's work continues to push the boundaries of Indian literature, offering a nuanced and multifaceted exploration of the complexities of the human experience.     Kitaab Saikat Majumdar, a professor of English and Creative Writing at Ashoka University, is a writer whose works delve deep into the intricacies of identity, desire, and the tensions between personal yearnings and institutional expectations.  With novels such as  ,  , and  , Majumdar has established himself as a unique voice in contemporary Indian literature. A seasoned writer and academic, Majumdar's literary trajectory is marked by a continuous exploration of human longing, repression, and the complex interplay between the self and societal structures. His previous works, such as   also published as   in the U.S. and  , further illuminate his distinctive voice, weaving together intricate psychological landscapes with critical commentaries on class, culture, and the human condition.  His exploration of human experiences in spaces defined by silence, repression, and societal constraints challenges traditional narratives, offering readers a profound reflection on the complexities of selfhood and the struggle for authenticity. This piece unpacks the recurring themes in Majumdar's writing, examining how his characters navigate the delicate interplay between desire, identity, and institutional pressures. In  , Majumdar's hallmark narrative approach emerges clearly: a sensitive, lyrical engagement with the inner lives of his characters, whose desires and vulnerabilities often clash with the cultural and institutional structures around them. Much like in his earlier works, Majumdar uses settings that are not merely backdrops but almost characters in their own right. Whether in the suffocating, monastic world of   or the theatre-focused realm of  , his settings are carefully crafted to reflect both the outward constraints of society and the internal struggles of the protagonists. These characters often find themselves caught in systems that demand conformity—be it the monastic discipline of   or the rigid structures of performance and fame in  . This tension between individuality and socialization is a recurring theme in Majumdar's writing, shaping the lives of his characters in ways both subtle and powerful. In Saikat Majumdar's works, themes of desire, identity, and alienation persistently take center stage, offering a layered and nuanced exploration of the human condition.  In  , the protagonist's life is an intricate dance between his pursuit of personal artistic fulfillment and the oppressive societal forces that demand conformity. Majumdar delves into the tension between the artist's creative desires and the constraining expectations imposed by the institutions that seek to shape his art. This internal conflict is not merely personal; it is deeply tied to the broader societal norms and pressures that dictate who one should be. Majumdar's portrayal of the artist's struggle is one of yearning—an attempt to carve out an authentic identity within a world that demands adherence to conventional norms. This thematic exploration of selfhood is not only a reflection of individual longing but also an examination of the dissonance between the private and public selves.  In  , these themes of desire and identity are amplified and complicated within the context of religious and monastic life. The protagonist, Anirvan, is drawn to the serenity and discipline of monastic life, hoping to achieve purity and spiritual enlightenment. Yet, his monastic aspirations are continually thwarted by his profound emotional and physical attraction to another person, Kajol. This conflict between spiritual aspiration and earthly desire reflects a deeper struggle within Anirvan's identity. While the monastic order professes celibacy and purity, Anirvan's desires—quiet, yet undeniable—force him to confront the contradictions of the very space he has chosen for transcendence. His journey becomes not just one of spiritual enlightenment but also one of grappling with the tensions between the self he is taught to be and the self he cannot deny. Majumdar's treatment of religious communities in   echoes the same questions explored in The Firebird, though this time with a sharper focus on the limitations and contradictions inherent in the structures meant to guide moral and spiritual lives.  Both novels probe the ways in which systems—be it art institutions or monastic orders—create spaces for individuals to form their identities, but these spaces are often fraught with tension. In the case of  , the artist's identity is formed and constrained by the expectations of society, while in  , Anirvan's identity is shaped by the monastic vow of celibacy, even as he struggles against the desires that threaten to disrupt it. Majumdar's works poignantly explore the tension between institutionalized ideals and human desires, illustrating the ways in which institutions—whether artistic, religious, or societal—attempt to control, shape, and suppress natural human yearnings.  In   the monastic community represents an extreme form of this control, wherein the vow of celibacy and spiritual discipline are intended to purify the body and mind. However, Majumdar reveals that human desires—particularly the intimate and sensual—are not so easily suppressed. The characters within this monastic world are forced to reckon with their own desires, which do not simply vanish in the face of doctrinal rigidity. Instead, they manifest in ways that complicate and destabilize the characters' sense of self. Anirvan, the protagonist, is torn between the monastic ideals he seeks to embody and the deep, human longing for connection that he experiences in his relationship with Kajol. This tension between ideal and reality—between the purity of spiritual practice and the fullness of human emotion—drives the narrative, revealing that attempts to control or eliminate desire often lead to inner turmoil rather than peace.  Majumdar suggests that desire is not a simple force to be eradicated or ignored, but an integral part of identity that informs who we are. The characters in  cannot fully suppress their longings, and as they try to reconcile their desires with the monastic discipline they have chosen, they experience profound internal conflict. This conflict extends beyond mere sexual or romantic desires and speaks to a broader struggle between personal authenticity and the external pressures of institutional expectations.

39,Silent verses on a bed of arrows,https://www.thedailystar.net/books-literature/news/silent-verses-bed-arrows-3826226, ,"'Shoroshojya', in the literal sense of the word, refers to the act of lying on a bed of arrows. It comes from Bhisma, a character in The Mahabharata, who had asked for 'ichcha mrityu' (death by one's own wish) when granted a boon by his father. In the War of Kurukshetra, Arjun had pierced Bhishma's flesh with so many arrows that his back would not touch the ground when he finally collapsed. Instead, he lay on a bed of arrows, writhing in excruciating pain until the city of Hastinapura was secured; and so, he could finally choose death. ""It's such a pathetic moment,"" said Akashleena Bhowmik, recalling this tale from The Mahabharata. ""This is the bed of arrows that Baba compares his own dire situation with, and why he decided to name his book  ."" As she continued to talk about her father Samyasathee Bhowmik, his new book, and the thought behind its title, Akashleena emphasised, "" is more than just a book. It's the war we've fought, the emotions we've felt, and it is the story of a person who fought for his life in the ICU for 56 days before returning to us, and to poetry."" So goes  's backstory. Its author, Samyasathee Bhowmik, is an established poet, and had been an associate professor at the Rajshahi College when he was diagnosed with Motor Neuron Disease (MND), a degenerative condition that affects the brain and nerves and causes muscle weakness, leading to the rapid deterioration of his health. Prior to his illness, Samyasathee's life had revolved around his love of both studying and teaching literature, as well as writing and translating poetry. He published three volumes of poetry, namely, Suprovat, Jibito Lok! in 2021, Amra Sorbonam in 2022, and Shorbongshoha in 2023 from Anyaprokash, during the Amar Ekushey Boi Mela. He also translated 25 Lalon songs, which were published in the book Baul Sangeet, published by Shilpakala Academy in 2010. The disease began with weakness in the muscles, but it was not long before Samyasathee struggled to perform routine, everyday tasks, and soon after, he could no longer find the strength to lift his pen. Following his MND diagnosis, his family's brutal journey through the medical system was filled with challenges, and involved several trips to India which did not prove to be entirely fruitful. One instance Akashleena recalls is how, after they had decided to return to Bangladesh for further treatment, her father's condition went through sudden, traumatic fluctuations and subsequent deterioration; this led to him being admitted to the ICU and put on life support. Struggling to navigate the hospital system and find assistance in the middle of the night, Akashleena went on Facebook live to ask friends and followers for help. In an incredibly heartwarming turn of events, the family received an outpouring of support from numerous students, colleagues, and relatives who arrived at the hospital by dawn, and with their help, Samyasathee was successfully shifted to Rajshahi Medical. However, his condition continued to deteriorate and the poet once again had to be relocated to a hospital in Dhaka. His ICU stay lasted a gruelling 56 days, in the midst of which he required a tracheostomy for a portable ventilator, rendering him unable to speak or communicate with his family. As Samyasathee's seemingly unending stay at the ICU stretched longer, the poet grew more distressed and depressed by the minute. After he was brought home from the ICU and a similar medical set-up had been installed at their house, his family decided to encourage him to return to his poetic habits. Even prior to his stay at the ICU, when the strength in his fingers had diminished and the poet could no longer lift his pen, he had dictated his poems to his family so that they could be recorded. The tracheostomy, however, posed a seemingly insurmountable challenge: How could someone communicate their poetry to another when they could not speak? Akashleena's studies in Communication Disorders at the University of Dhaka proved to have given her some unique insight into the situation. Using what she had been taught at university, she learned to work out ways to communicate with her father; before long, the two had returned to the task of recording his poetry. But this, too, was an arduous task. Poems that had taken minutes to transcribe when Samyasathee dictated them now took hours. As Akashleena attempted to lip-read the poems her father tried to communicate, each letter, word, and line had to be discerned with great difficulty. These poems, together with the ones that had been collected prior to Samyasathee's ICU stay, comprised the poet's fourth book,  . The poems compiled in this volume reflect the struggle and the pain that not only Samyasathee, but his entire family has suffered through in the past year and longer. What both the book and Akashleena also highlight is the resolve and resilience exhibited by Devayani Chakraborty, the poet's wife, throughout this ordeal.  's dedication page reads:

40,Celebrating diversity and language at “Bhasha Utshob 2025”,https://www.thedailystar.net/culture/books/news/celebrating-diversity-and-language-bhasha-utshob-2025-3834916,Bashirah Tahreema  Bashirah Tahreema   ,"Gulshan Society held a two-day language festival at the Gulshan Lake Park, curated by Sadaf Saaz and Jatrik. The event took place over the weekend of 21-22 February that saw discussion panels, original musical performances, and poetry recitations, surrounded by an array of book stalls and food courts. The opening ceremony began with a poetry recitation celebrating our different languages. Many talented poets of different ethnicities bared their souls to the audience with original pieces of poetry in English, Monipuri, and Garo language based both on the Language Movement of 1952 and their personal experiences with their language. After hearing from poets Adrita Zaima Islam, Mithun Raksam, and Maibam Sadhon, the event followed with a panel discussing ""Language of Resistance"" with artist and curator Shehzad Chowdhury, artist Dhrubani Mahbub, and Assistant Professor at the Department of Bangla at Dhaka University and author Rafat Alam, moderated by Nazia Manzoor,  the Editor of Star Books and Literature,  , and Assistant Professor and Chair of the Department of English and Modern Languages at North South University. Nazia Manzoor prompted the conversation by asking ""Can art itself be a form of resistance?""  to which Dhrubani Mahbub replied ""I think art itself is a resistance. Rebellious is its nature. We artists will always strive and fail to find happiness because we are always protesting against unfairness caused by people in power."" She continued, ""However, I believe, I am alive and I am capable of love and that is also an expression of art."" She ended by saying ""We all owe something to each other, as artists, as humans, as Bangalis and that is love."" The event followed with a discussion, ""Crafts and confessions: A deconstruction of flash fiction"" led by Sabrina Fatma Ahmed and Abak Hussain, founder and director of Talespeople respectively, discussing the flexibility of approaching flash fiction as a writer and the inauthenticity of AI writing. They also spoke of the lack of individuality and intimacy in AI writing, reassuring how humans will never be short of stories to tell. In addition, another conversational panel followed, ""Other Tongues: Immersed In Translation"" with Kaiser Haq, Rifat Munim, Mojaffor Hossain, Srabonti Datta, and Noora Shamsi Bahar discussing the diversity of different languages in our culture and the importance of engaging in translated works. The panel challenged the overrated notion of prioritising English literature while emphasising the need to embrace translated works by authors from diverse backgrounds. During the event, attendees explored the wide variety of books and food stalls. Next, a riveting hour ' 'Jiboner Saathe Golpokotha'  with Shayan was followed by the all-female indigenous band, F minor, who entranced the audience with singing in different languages of Bangladesh,  and covers of songs inspired by the language movement. There were then recitations of classic Bangla poetry by veterans Dahlia Ahmed and Shimul Mustapha, and the day ended with the book launch  Da Vinci Club, a thriller by Mohammad Nizamuddin. On the final day, 22 February, several more panels were held throughout the day, including an inspiring 'In their own words' panel. One of the most interactive sessions was ""The Art of Reading and Writing"", featuring Farah Ghuznavi, author of the book Fragments of Riversong (Daily Star Books, 2013). She encouraged the aspiring writers in the audience to draft out their ideas as much as possible and emphasised the importance of building a relationship of respect and familiarity with readers. Following this, an insightful discussion was held on fiction writing with author Saad Z Hossain discussing struggles of storytelling in politically sensitive climates. The event concluded with an engaging performance by Warda Ashraf. 
 Gulshan Society held a two-day language festival at the Gulshan Lake Park, curated by Sadaf Saaz and Jatrik. The event took place over the weekend of 21-22 February that saw discussion panels, original musical performances, and poetry recitations, surrounded by an array of book stalls and food courts. The opening ceremony began with a poetry recitation celebrating our different languages. Many talented poets of different ethnicities bared their souls to the audience with original pieces of poetry in English, Monipuri, and Garo language based both on the Language Movement of 1952 and their personal experiences with their language. After hearing from poets Adrita Zaima Islam, Mithun Raksam, and Maibam Sadhon, the event followed with a panel discussing ""Language of Resistance"" with artist and curator Shehzad Chowdhury, artist Dhrubani Mahbub, and Assistant Professor at the Department of Bangla at Dhaka University and author Rafat Alam, moderated by Nazia Manzoor,  the Editor of Star Books and Literature,  , and Assistant Professor and Chair of the Department of English and Modern Languages at North South University. Nazia Manzoor prompted the conversation by asking ""Can art itself be a form of resistance?""  to which Dhrubani Mahbub replied ""I think art itself is a resistance. Rebellious is its nature. We artists will always strive and fail to find happiness because we are always protesting against unfairness caused by people in power."" She continued, ""However, I believe, I am alive and I am capable of love and that is also an expression of art.""

41,Between tradition and taboo: The arranged marriage trope in Bangla dark romance literature,https://www.thedailystar.net/culture/books/news/between-tradition-and-taboo-the-arranged-marriage-trope-bangla-dark-romance-literature-3834921,Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not endorse or condone any form of abuse or exploitation. Nazmus Sadat  Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not endorse or condone any form of abuse or exploitation. Nazmus Sadat   ,"In a packed room at Bookworm Bangladesh on January 11, 2025, an unusual literary discussion unfolded, marking a significant shift in Bangladesh's conservative literary landscape. The event, ""Trigger Warning: Dark Romance"", organised by Sister Library in collaboration with Bookworm Bangladesh and Star Books and Literature, brought together diverse voices to explore the emerging world of dark romance literature. While the panel—featuring dark romance author Shanjida Nushrath Ali; Dr Nazia Manzoor, Editor of Star Books and Literature and Chair of the Department of English and Modern Languages, NSU; Dr. Kaiser Huq, academic, translator, and poet; and literary critic Shahriar Shaams—explored various aspects of the genre, one particular element stood out: the transformation of traditional arranged marriage narratives in contemporary dark romance. Unlike traditional romance, dark romance delves into themes of obsession, coercion, and psychological danger, often blurring the lines of consent and exploring morally ambiguous characters. Erotica, on the other hand, centers on intimacy and desire. While it may share elements with erotica's focus on intimacy and desire, dark romance distinguishes itself through its complex narrative structures and moral ambiguity. This evolution in romantic fiction is finding a growing audience in Bangladesh, as noted by Bookworm's owner, Amina Rahman, during the event. This growing appetite signals a shift in reader preferences, with many seeking narratives that push boundaries. The arranged marriage trope in dark romance frequently serves as a clash between traditional values and contemporary desires. Traditionally perceived as a means of securing familial alliances, arranged marriage takes on a different dimension in dark romance—becoming a battleground for power struggles, forbidden desires, and intense emotional conflict. This tension resonates strongly in South Asian contexts, where marriage is often seen as a duty rather than a personal choice. In this evolving landscape, authors like Shanjida Nushrath Ali are pushing the limits of mainstream fiction by introducing bold themes previously unexplored. Except for a handful of examples like Humayun Azad's  (Agamee Prakashani, 2004), which actually somewhat had dark romance and erotic elements, historically, Bangladeshi eroticism has existed largely in the underground choti genre—short, mostly explicit fiction often circulated informally. However, unlike choti, which prioritises physical encounters over storytelling, dark romance incorporates psychological depth, intricate power dynamics. Choti often focuses solely on physical encounters, frequently lacking the character development and narrative sophistication found in dark romance. This difference is crucial, as dark romance uses its exploration of desire and power to delve into complex emotional landscapes. During the panel discussion, Dr Manzoor highlighted a crucial aspect: ""The reason why dark romance draws you is because it often deals with female desire. When women want to take control of their desire, and it is in the shape of darkness, what stories can you find then?"" The arranged marriage trope in dark romance frequently serves as a clash between traditional values and contemporary desires. Traditionally perceived as a means of securing familial alliances, arranged marriage takes on a different dimension in dark romance—becoming a battleground for power struggles, forbidden desires, and intense emotional conflict. This tension resonates strongly in South Asian contexts, where marriage is often seen as a duty rather than a personal choice. While not dark romance per se, Humayun Ahmed's work often explores the psychological impact of forced relationships and the suppression of individual desire in traditional marriages. For example, in  (Khan Brothers, 1973), the character of Bilkis, though betrothed in an arranged marriage, harbours a deep longing for a different life and love. While not explicitly erotic, the undercurrent of her repressed desires hints at the psychological complexities that arranged marriages can entail. Similarly, Selina Hossain's  (Anannya Prokashoni, 2003) portrays the complex power dynamics within arranged marriages through Jamila, showing how women in such setups often navigate complex emotional landscapes, hinting at both resilience and suppressed desires, even in dire circumstances like wartime. These examples, though from mainstream literature, illustrate the existing tension between tradition and individual agency, coercion, power imbalance, and emotional conflict—tensions that dark romance explores more explicitly. A hallmark of dark romance is the presence of dominant, often morally grey heroes. In arranged marriage narratives, this translates to a protagonist bound—willingly or unwillingly—to a powerful, often dangerous partner. This fuels stories of coercion, psychological tension, and reluctant attraction. For example, Cora Reilly's  (2014) explores an arranged marriage in the mafia, blending themes of loyalty, passion, and danger. These narratives often begin with mistrust but evolve into dark, intense love—a defining element of the genre. The forced proximity inherent in an arranged marriage setting often fuels the slow-burn passion characteristic of dark romance. The genre thrives on tension, drawing characters together by obligation while simultaneously forcing them to resist their growing attraction. This push and pull between duty and desire amplifies the emotional stakes, creating a compelling narrative dynamic. For example, a dominant hero might initially exert control, but the heroine's resistance can lead to a gradual shift in the power balance, adding another layer of complexity to their evolving relationship. This forced proximity psychological interplay is evident in novels like  (2019) by LJ Shen, where the protagonist initially resists her arranged marriage, only to find herself entangled in a complex web of power, control, and reluctant attraction. The gradual shift in power dynamics and the deepening emotional stakes are what make dark romance distinct from both traditional romance and pure erotica. Bangladesh, too, has a complex relationship with erotic literature which sometimes reflects a broader cultural tension between tradition and modernity; explicit discussions of desire, consent, and power have remained largely absent in mainstream fiction. This lack of representation created a gap between reality and literature, as themes of passion and coercion were often softened or ignored altogether. This self-censorship in mainstream fiction revealed not just literary boundaries, but deeper societal resistance to confronting these themes openly and sometimes with consequences. The recent emergence of dark romance, however, represents a potential shift, not just in foreign literature but also in Bangladeshi literature, welcoming discussions on previously taboo topics. The panel discussion at Bookworm Bangladesh also emphasised the need for open dialogue around these narratives—not as a means of sensationalising them, but to acknowledge the realities of power imbalances and emotional complexity in relationships. Without addressing these themes, literature risks failing to fully capture the depth of human experience. How does dark romance fit into Bangladeshi literature? Can arranged marriage narratives in dark romance bridge the gap between tradition and modernity? These are complex questions. Dr Kaiser Huq, a notable voice in contemporary Bangladeshi literature, observed that genres like dark romance challenge traditional literary boundaries, offering fresh perspectives on social structures and relationships. This observation is the key. Dark romance, by its very nature, pushes against established norms, forcing a re-examination of traditional power dynamics within relationships. For instance, the arranged marriage trope, when explored through the lens of dark romance, can expose the underlying power imbalances inherent in such arrangements. It can also explore the often-unspoken desires and frustrations of individuals trapped within these structures. Therefore, dark romance, while controversial, has the potential to offer critical commentary on traditional practices, prompting important conversations about consent, agency, and the evolving nature of relationships in modern society. It can bridge the gap by exploring the unspoken undercurrents of tradition, bringing them to the forefront in a way that sparks dialogue and challenges conventional thinking. Yet, the persistent taboo surrounding dark romance in Bangladeshi literature reflects a broader cultural reluctance to engage with themes of desire, power, and agency—particularly within the context of traditional institutions like arranged marriage. But as evidenced by the growing readership of both translated dark romance works and emerging Bangladeshi online fiction, there is a clear appetite for narratives that challenge these boundaries. As Bangladeshi literature embraces bolder storytelling, will local authors rise to the challenge of reinterpreting this trope for a South Asian audience? As mentioned, since the demand is there—perhaps all that's needed is a writer willing to take the plunge. The potential for this transformation rests with a new generation of writers, poised to redefine both the genre and the landscape of Bangladeshi literature. This growing openness to host such conversations, combined with the rising generation of writers who are increasingly willing to explore these themes, points to an exciting evolution in Bangladeshi literature—one that might finally bridge the gap between traditional storytelling and contemporary desires.

45,Grubhub to fire 500 employees,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/grubhub-fire-500-employees-3837646, ,"Grubhub, the US-based food delivery company, has announced plans to lay off approximately 500 employees, representing more than 20% of its workforce, according to an official letter by Grubhub CEO Howard Migdal. The decision comes as the company integrates its operations with Wonder, the food delivery startup that acquired Grubhub last month. CEO Migal says the move aims to streamline the business and eliminate duplication following the takeover.   In an email sent to employees on Friday, Migdal explained that the job cuts are part of efforts to ""prioritise the right work and execute with speed and conviction"". He stated that the layoffs span all teams and are necessary to align Grubhub's operations with Wonder's vision of becoming ""the primary destination for mealtime"". Migdal described the decision as ""difficult"" but essential for the company's future growth.   Grubhub, which had over 2,200 full-time employees as of 2024, was previously owned by Just Eat Takeaway, Europe's largest meal delivery firm. According to a report by Reuters, Just Eat sold Grubhub for $650 million in 2023 after struggling with slowing growth and high taxes, a significant loss compared to the billions it paid to acquire the company in 2020.   Since the acquisition by Wonder, led by former Walmart executive Marc Lore, Grubhub has been exploring ways to innovate and reduce costs. Last month, the company partnered with autonomous technology startup Avride to deploy delivery robots on US college campuses, aiming to address labour shortages and reduce reliance on cars, states the Reuters report.   In his email, Migdal assured affected employees that they would receive severance packages and outplacement services to support their transition. He also announced plans for a town hall meeting in March to discuss the company's strategy for 2025 and the path forward.   The layoffs highlight the challenges facing the competitive food delivery industry, where companies are under pressure to cut costs and improve efficiency. Migdal, in his message, expressed confidence in Grubhub's future, stating that the partnership with Wonder positions the company to ""disrupt the restaurant industry and redefine how people think about food delivery"".   Grubhub, the US-based food delivery company, has announced plans to lay off approximately 500 employees, representing more than 20% of its workforce, according to an official letter by Grubhub CEO Howard Migdal.

46,Sophos posts research on new SVG phishing cyberthreat,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/sophos-posts-research-new-svg-phishing-cyberthreat-3840166, ,"Sophos X-Ops, the threat research unit of Sophos, has posted   on a new phishing cyberthreat that is exploiting the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file format. According to Sophos, cybercriminals increasingly leverage SVG files—a graphics format containing XML-like text instructions—to evade anti-phishing and anti-spam protections. The research, published recently, reveals that phishing gangs have adopted a technique of sending weaponised SVG files as email attachments since late last year. These files, when opened, redirect victims to malicious sites hosting phishing kits, posing significant risks to individuals and organisations alike, says Sophos. As per the research by Sophos, this is how the attacks work: Cybercriminals send emails with SVG file attachments to their targets. The SVG file, when clicked, opens in the target's browser by default. The file contains embedded links or JavaScript that redirects the browser to a phishing site. Victims are presented with fake prompts, such as requests to open a document hosted on platforms like DocuSign, Dropbox, or SharePoint, or to listen to a voicemail message via Google Voice. Sophos X-Ops says that it has also discovered that nearly half of the SVG files analysed were highly customised, with the target's email address or name embedded directly into the file. This level of personalisation suggests these attacks are being used for targeted campaigns against specific companies, says Sophos.

48,How to stay productive at work while fasting,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/how-stay-productive-work-while-fasting-3839261, ,"Fasting during Ramadan for spiritual reasons is a deeply rewarding experience, but it can also be challenging when balancing a full day of work. Between low energy, dehydration, and an unpredictable sleep schedule, staying focused and productive can feel like an uphill battle. However, with some smart strategies, you can manage your workload effectively without burning out. One of the best ways to maintain productivity while fasting is to plan your workday around your energy levels. Right after Sehri, the morning time is when you are likely to feel the most refreshed and alert. This is the ideal time to tackle the most important and mentally demanding tasks. As the day progresses and fatigue starts setting in, save routine or easier tasks for the afternoon. Using a planner or a to-do list can help you stay on track without overwhelming yourself. Working smarter, not harder, is key during this time. Focusing on priority tasks first helps avoid last-minute stress, and breaking big projects into smaller, manageable steps can make them feel less daunting. Whenever possible, automating repetitive tasks or delegating work to others can lighten your workload and prevent exhaustion. Leveraging technology can also make a huge difference in managing your energy throughout the day. Productivity tools like Notion, Asana, or Google Calendar can help keep your tasks organised, while automation apps like Zapier or Microsoft Power Automate can handle repetitive work for you. AI-powered assistants like ChatGPT can be useful for quick research, drafting emails, or summarising information efficiently. Additionally, opting for video calls instead of in-person meetings can help conserve energy. ""By planning meals wisely, staying active, and optimising sleep, professionals can maintain their focus and efficiency even while fasting,"" says Farhana Preeti, AVP of Business Development at Shajgoj Limited. According to her, a well-balanced Sehri, rich in protein, fibre, and complex carbohydrates, provides sustained energy, while proper hydration between Iftar and Sehri is essential for overall well-being. She also advises against consuming sugary or fried foods, as they can lead to sluggishness and reduced focus. Taking breaks and allowing yourself to recharge is just as important as managing your workload. Short breaks can be used to stretch, take a quick walk, or practice breathing exercises. The Pomodoro technique—working for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break—can help maintain productivity while preventing burnout. If your workplace allows, a quick power nap of 15-20 minutes can be incredibly refreshing. Optimising your workspace and using smart productivity hacks can further enhance focus. Keeping your desk clutter-free minimises distractions, while apps like Forest or Brain.fm can create an environment conducive to concentration. Pre-written email templates can save time on routine communications, allowing you to work more efficiently. Ayman Sadiq, CEO of 10 Minute School, shared his tips for staying productive during Ramadan: ""Adjust your desk and chair height for better posture and position your laptop and mouse ergonomically to avoid strain. And most importantly, no multitasking—focus on deep work to maximise efficiency."" Handling meetings and communication wisely is another crucial aspect of maintaining productivity while fasting. Important meetings should be scheduled in the morning when your energy and concentration levels are higher. Keeping emails and discussions brief helps conserve energy, and using voice notes instead of long text messages can be a time-saver. Collaboration tools like Slack, Trello, or Microsoft Teams streamline communication, making work more manageable. Staying positive and motivated throughout the fasting period can make a significant difference. Reminding yourself of the spiritual purpose behind fasting helps reinforce discipline and patience. Practising gratitude can improve your mindset, and celebrating small wins—like completing tasks on time despite fasting— will keep you motivated. For those dealing with traffic jams during their commute, planning ahead can reduce stress. If remote work or flexible hours are an option, they can help avoid unnecessary travel fatigue. Keeping water and light snacks handy in case you're stuck in traffic at Iftar time is a practical solution, and using navigation apps to plan your route can help you avoid heavily congested areas. Many professionals who fast say that adjusting their sleep schedule is key to staying productive. Some prefer handling complex tasks in the morning and leaving creative work for the evening when they feel more relaxed. Health experts also recommend light physical activity, such as short walks, to keep blood circulation going. Experienced professionals advise setting realistic daily goals and avoiding an overloaded schedule—fasting is a time for balance, not burnout. At the end of the day, fasting and work can go hand in hand with the right approach. By staying organised, working smart, and taking care of your health, you can navigate your workday efficiently without feeling overwhelmed. The key is to pace yourself, stay mindful of your energy levels, and remember that you don't have to do everything simultaneously. Work smart, not hard, and you'll end your day feeling accomplished.

Nasheed: DS: Have you encountered any unique operational challenges in Bangladesh compared to other markets? Nasheed: DS: Thank you for giving time to our readers. Nasheed:  ","Since its launch in Bangladesh in 2016, the global ride-sharing platform Uber has significantly influenced the country's mobility landscape. A recently unveiled report, compiled by UK-based research firm Public First, highlighted Uber's overall contribution of BDT 5,500 crore to the country's economy last year.  The Daily Star sat down with Nasheed Ferdous Kamal, Country Head, Uber Bangladesh, and Amy Price, Director - Head of Tech, Media and Telecoms Practice at Public First, to discuss Uber's economic and social impact, responses to safety challenges and debates facing the gig economy, and the future of ride-sharing in Bangladesh.  We were really excited to take on this project because it's important to assess not only the consumer benefits of Uber but also its broader economic impact. The report estimates that Uber contributed BDT 55 billion to the Bangladesh economy in a single year. It's important to clarify that this is not Uber's profit—it's the combined direct and indirect economic impact of Uber's operations. The platform creates a ripple effect, benefiting earners, consumers, and businesses across various sectors.  Mobility has completely transformed since Uber entered the market. It has made transportation more accessible, affordable, and reliable. Just imagine Dhaka without Uber—most of us have already forgotten what that was like. This report quantifies what we already feel—Uber saves time, creates employment, and contributes to the economy in ways that go beyond just ride-sharing. If people save time, they can be more productive. If drivers earn more, they spend more, stimulating economic activity.  Innovation remains at our core. Right now, our priority is strengthening our existing services and expanding into more cities beyond Dhaka. We have introduced multiple ride categories to cater to different consumer needs, and our next steps involve enhancing the customer experience and scaling our operations. Bringing in new services like Uber Bus is something we're always evaluating, but our current focus is on improving reliability and safety. Safety is a top priority for Uber. Our app has several built-in safety features, including GPS tracking, emergency buttons, and trip-sharing options that allow riders to share their location with family and friends. Additionally, we have a dedicated team that investigates complaints. If an issue is flagged, we immediately contact the rider and driver and take appropriate action, including suspensions or bans if necessary. Yes, we do. If law enforcement or regulatory bodies request information, we comply within legal and regulatory frameworks. However, we don't share data indiscriminately. Each request is evaluated, and we only provide relevant information as required by law.  It depends on the situation. If a security issue or a serious incident occurs, then yes, we provide relevant data to assist authorities. But in general, our role is to balance safety, privacy, and compliance with legal requirements.  While we didn't ask that exact question in our survey, we did find that over 60% of drivers prefer driving through Uber over street hailing. They see benefits in terms of security, reliability, and steady earnings.  Also, the safety features that protect riders—like GPS tracking and trip insurance—apply to drivers as well. Unlike offline rides, where neither party is covered, Uber ensures that both riders and drivers are protected in case of an incident.  We actively discourage offline rides because they compromise security for both riders and drivers. When trips are tracked on the app, there's a record of the ride, the fare is transparent, and both parties are protected. We conduct training and awareness programs for drivers to highlight the risks of offline trips. But addressing this issue requires a collaborative effort—from drivers, riders, and policymakers alike.  Uber drivers are independent partners, not employees, so we don't mandate formal training. However, we regularly communicate guidelines, safety measures, and community standards to ensure they understand the best practices.  The gig economy thrives on flexibility. Our drivers are free to choose when and how much they want to work, which wouldn't be possible if they were employees with fixed shifts. Rather than focusing on classification, I think the bigger discussion should be on improving working conditions and benefits for gig workers, ensuring they get the best possible earnings and protections while maintaining their independence. We encourage healthy competition because it benefits the entire ecosystem—riders get better services, and drivers have more opportunities. The ride-sharing industry is still growing, and we welcome more players to drive innovation and service quality.  Digital payments are an important focus, but adoption has been slow because many drivers aren't comfortable with the adjustment process. We're working on solutions to make digital transactions easier and more accessible for them.  It's been a rollercoaster ride—from handling economic shifts and driver protests to launching the economic impact report. Balancing growth and operational challenges has been both exciting and demanding. A big part of my role has been understanding customer pain points, directly engaging with drivers, and adapting Uber to local needs.  Absolutely. Bangladesh is a unique market in many ways. The pace of digital transformation, the high population density, and evolving regulatory policies create both challenges and opportunities. What excites me is the sheer potential—Bangladesh is embracing ride-sharing at an incredible rate, and we want to keep building on that momentum.

The model, internally referred to as Orion, is OpenAI's largest to date and has been developed with increased computing power and data. Despite these enhancements, OpenAI has stated that it does not classify GPT-4.5 as a ""frontier model."" GPT-4.5 is now accessible to ChatGPT Pro subscribers, who pay $200 per month, as well as developers using OpenAI's paid API tiers. Other ChatGPT users, including those on the ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Team plans, are expected to gain access next week, according to an OpenAI spokesperson. GPT-4.5 follows the same training methodology as previous GPT models, leveraging a large-scale unsupervised learning process. OpenAI reports that the model demonstrates improvements in knowledge, emotional intelligence, and factual accuracy. On the company's internal SimpleQA benchmark, which tests AI models on factual questions, GPT-4.5 outperforms OpenAI's widely used GPT-4o model and other proprietary reasoning models such as o1 and o3-mini. The model is also reported to generate fewer incorrect or misleading responses compared to previous versions. However, GPT-4.5 does not consistently outperform leading AI reasoning models. On academic benchmarks such as AIME and GPQA, which assess complex reasoning and problem-solving abilities, GPT-4.5 falls behind competitors including DeepSeek's R1 and Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet. In software development benchmarks, GPT-4.5 matches GPT-4o's performance in some coding tasks but is outperformed by OpenAI's own deep research model and other industry alternatives. The release of GPT-4.5 comes amid ongoing discussions about the limits of AI scaling. OpenAI, like other AI research firms, has historically increased model performance by expanding training datasets and computational resources. However, some industry experts, including OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, have suggested that this approach is reaching a point of diminishing returns. AI developers have increasingly shifted focus toward reasoning models, which prioritize more efficient problem-solving over sheer scale. OpenAI has indicated that future models, including GPT-5, will incorporate elements from both the GPT and o series to enhance AI capabilities. ""We're sharing GPT‐4.5 as a research preview to better understand its strengths and limitations,"" OpenAI stated in a blog post. ""We're still exploring what it's capable of and are eager to see how people use it in ways we might not have expected."" GPT-4.5 is among OpenAI's most expensive models to operate. API access costs $75 per million input tokens (approximately 750,000 words) and $150 per million output tokens. By comparison, GPT-4o—currently OpenAI's primary model for most API and ChatGPT interactions—costs significantly less at $2.50 per million input tokens and $10 per million output tokens. Due to the high computational cost of running GPT-4.5, OpenAI has stated that it is still evaluating whether the model will be maintained for long-term API access.

54,What is happening at KUET?,https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/what-happening-kuet-3834616, ,"On February 17, members of the Jatiotabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD), the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) were distributing membership forms on the campus of Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (KUET). Owing to the decision made by the 93rd (emergency) Syndicate meeting on August 11, 2024, which banned all political activities on campus, general students viewed this as a direct violation. Thus, protests erupted the following day on Tuesday, February 18. According to accounts by KUET students present at the campus that day, the situation escalated during a protest by the general students when they passed a group of JCD members and removed them from campus. Following this, students claim that JCD members brought local BNP members into the campus, after which clashes erupted between them and the general students. Police sources say that around 45 people were injured while the students and a teacher say the number is around 150. The injured were taken to Khulna Medical College Hospital, the Khulna Medical Centre, and other clinics. Following the incident, on Tuesday night, the general students demanded that the vice chancellor (VC) of the university, Dr Muhammad Masud, take responsibility for his failure to ensure the safety of students and step down alongside the pro-vice chancellor and the director of student welfare. They further demanded that cases be filed by the university authorities against perpetrators, medical expenses of all injured students be covered by the university, student politics be officially banned on campus, anyone involved in politics be expelled, and for the military to provide security until February 28. These demands come in the wake of the students claiming there were delays on the part of the university authorities in calling law enforcement agencies on time, even though the clash lasted about four hours. Students have expressed further grievances about university authorities and teachers taking no significant actions to ensure the safety of their students while the clash was happening. Despite the students' ultimatum of boycotting all classes and exams lest their demands be met by 1 PM on Wednesday, February 19, their demands were not fulfilled, to which they responded by locking the administrative and academic buildings at 1:30 PM.  which resulted in the VC accepting most of the students' demands, including that of banning all student politics on campus and expulsion of all those engaged in the clash that ensued on Tuesday, February 18. However, the call for the resignation of university authority personnel was not heard. The students announced that all academic activities would be suspended until February 28 to ensure students' safety. Protests erupted on campuses across the country, including at Dhaka University, Chittagong University, Jahangirnagar University, and Jagannath University, in solidarity with the students of KUET who stood against student politics. Videos showcasing persons carrying machetes and an individual firing a gun amidst the clash went viral on social media on Tuesday afternoon. BCD has since denied any claims regarding their members or affiliated individuals being the perpetrators in the videos. At a press conference on Wednesday, BCD General Secretary Nasir Uddin Nasir claimed that it was members of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement (ADSM) that initiated the attack, with Omar Faruk, convenor of KUET ADSM being identified as an instigator. Ahmed Ishtiaque, former head of the Khulna city Chhatra Dal, claimed that the Islami Chhatra Shibir and Chhatro League were trying to stop the activities of BCD. Further claims were made that members of BCD blocked an attack on regular students by the Chhatro Shibir and Chhatro League. Arafat Hossain Millon, president of the Khulna city Islami Chatra Shibir, denied any such claims. On Thursday, cases were filed by the university authorities against 500 unnamed individuals involved in the clash on Tuesday. KUET students carried out a Red Card protest on campus to reiterate their demands, including the resignation of university authorities and legal action against perpetrators. On Friday, the students locked the VC's residence while the VC was in Dhaka for medical treatment, saying that their demands had not been fulfilled and denying all allegations of mistreatment of the VC. They also carried out an exhibition at the Student Welfare Centre titled ""Roktakto Kuet 18.02.25"". On Saturday, students marched within campus premises, frustrated that their demands had not been met. They claimed that no perpetrators had been arrested, no acknowledgement of responsibility was made by university authorities, the VC did not acknowledge the involvement of the BCD or BNP, and that the university authorities were complicit in the attacks that happened as they were enabling student politics on campus. The general students also submitted a letter via email to the Chief Adviser of the Interim Government, Prof Muhammad Yunus, asking for their demands to be fulfilled. The following day, on February 23, 80 KUET students headed to Dhaka and a delegation of  , whose assistant personal secretary met the students. The students restated their six-point demands there, which included the immediate resignation of the VC and pro-VC, legal punishment against perpetrators of the attack, a ban on student politics on campus, ensuring student safety, removal of the ghost case against 500 unnamed individuals which the students feared would be utilised against them, and appointment of a new VC. They further described the horrors of the clash on February 18, including the responsibility that they feel the university authorities must bear. On February 24, the students broke the lock on the VC's residence and asked him to vacate the house by the next morning when he returned to his residence. Failure to meet the demand led to the students attempting to lock the residence again in the morning with the VC and teachers inside but they stopped once the teachers came out and talked them down, with some students claiming that the teachers threatened to hamper the students' academics otherwise. On February 25, the KUET administration issued a notice declaring all academic activities to be suspended indefinitely due to security concerns and instructed students to vacate all residence halls by 10 AM on February 26 following a decision made during the 99th syndicate meeting.

56,Why studying abroad is becoming harder for Bangladeshi students,https://www.thedailystar.net/rising-stars/news/why-studying-abroad-becoming-harder-bangladeshi-students-3834336,Canada Australia The United Kingdom The United States Germany Finland and Hong Kong *Names have been changed upon request. References: Canada Australia The United Kingdom The United States Germany Finland and Hong Kong *Names have been changed upon request. References:  ,"Over the past decade or so, there has been a rather noticeable rise in the number of  . Destinations like the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and Germany, have been particular favourites amongst those wanting to begin their higher education journey in a foreign country. In recent times, however, these countries have been adopting policies and undergoing changes that are making it harder for Bangladeshi students to go abroad. Canada has been attempting to reduce international student intake for the past two years. In response to the housing and healthcare crises in Canada, where many residents are unable to find affordable housing and health services, Canada mapped out the 2025 to 2027 Immigration Levels Plan to bring down the number of international students making their way into Canada, based upon the belief that the pressure of accommodating international students has resulted in the country's current infrastructural issues.  At the beginning of 2024, the Canadian administration implemented changes that sought to reduce the number of international study permits by 35 percent. A few months ago, the administration announced it would introduce a further 10 percent reduction in the study permits issued in 2025 and 2026. Needless to say, the ramifications of these decisions have been widely felt. Orchid Benedict Gomes, a first-year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering at Toronto Metropolitan University, is one of the countless students affected. ""I had to apply multiple times before I got the acceptance for the study permit, and once I received it, it wasn't offered for the full length – four years – of the course. The permit was offered to me for two years, after which I must apply for an extension. This is a problem because many students fail to receive this extension and are sent back to their countries,"" Orchid explains. Anindya Chowdhury, managing partner and CEO of Mentors' Study Abroad, points out, ""2024 was a bad year for Bangladeshi students looking to pursue higher studies abroad. Even for students who had the necessary financial documents and who received scholarships, there were study permit rejections. I think we saw a 40 percent decrease in the number of permits granted."" Besides, Canada also raised the average living costs that international students have to show on their study permit papers from CAD 10,000 to CAD 20,635, a step that has made Canada a significantly more unreachable destination for many study abroad aspirants. However, students say that the current living costs are usually less than the number they are asked to show, as most international students don't opt for student residences. Instead, they rent apartments with other students or reside with their extended families living there. This is a substantial financial burden and it becomes difficult for many to show the required funds along with the tuitions for the first semester. International students have always been a strong source of income for Canadian universities, with most international students paying tuition fees six times the value of the tuition fees paid by Canadian citizens. There is speculation that higher education institutions in Canada will be raising their international tuition fees to counteract their losses from the reduced international student intakes, making it harder for many Bangladeshi students to be able to pay for a Canadian degree. Moreover, Canadian universities are notorious for their near-abysmal scholarship opportunities at the undergraduate level, so students can receive no reprieve from that end either.  Moreover, in the past two years, restrictions have been placed on work permits for spouses of international students. However, now there is also talk of post-graduation work permits (PGWPs) becoming more difficult for students themselves. Orchid expresses his concern in this regard, ""I believe the Canadian government will become stricter on the GPA requirements or the type of major you have before granting a PGWP in the future. This will negatively impact the chances of getting permanent residence (PR) in Canada for international students like me who want to settle here after graduation."" On the future of Bangladeshi students in Canada, Anindya says, ""Since the beginning of 2025, we have seen a rise in the proportion of study permit acceptances to Canada. However, that could be because fewer students have been applying to Canada to begin with, put off by the fear of harsh permit policies.""  Australia has been attempting to follow in the same vein. While there was some talk about the Australian government introducing a cap on the number of incoming international students from 2025, the bill was ultimately not passed but the authorities came back with a new visa processing structure in place of the cap. The new structure might, in turn, result in visa processing delays, with many students having to defer their enrolment.  What Australia may not have been able to do in the form of caps, it has done through a range of other measures already. Aranyo Rishi Chowdhury, a high school graduate who had been hoping to apply to Australian universities this year, explains the reasons behind his determent, ""Even though Australia was one of my top choices for pursuing my undergraduate degree, I was put off by the lacklustre scholarship opportunities available. With most meritorious students receiving a maximum of 40 percent scholarship, I simply couldn't afford Australia. I would have to work part-time jobs just to be able to pay off tuition and miss out on all other aspects of my university life."" Not only has the Australian government raised the minimum IELTS score requirement for a student visa from 5.5 to 6, they doubled the student visa application fee from AUD 710  to AUD 1,600 and increased the proof of savings from AUD 24,505 to AUD 29,710 in 2024. This, coupled with the post-pandemic reductions in scholarship opportunities, is certainly discouraging for Bangladeshi students, many of whom can't afford the nearly ostentatious costs of attendance at Australian universities without multiple part-time jobs.  Australia's relatively new Genuine Student Test, as part of their visa interview process, has also been a step the country has taken to curb the number of fraudulent students entering the country just to work low-wage jobs. Quazi Fuad, an incoming freshman at the University of New South Wales, highlights the hurdles he faced with this addition, ""I had to write my answers for the Genuine Student Test twice, because my answers weren't good enough, and my agent ultimately ended up having to help me with it."" Additionally, the increasing emphasis on practical, professional degrees and a move away from the humanities and social sciences in countries like Australia and the United Kingdom has meant that universities are subtly discouraging students from studying these subjects which can be a strong negative for students interested in the humanities.  On the UK scene, Anindya comments, ""The UK, as a study abroad destination, has become drastically less popular over the past two years because of the restrictions on spouse visas. For those hoping to take their close ones on a dependent visa, recent restrictions have certainly been a massive blow."" International student tuition fees in the UK start from around GBP 13,000 and the average cost would be around GBP 20,000, and students have to carry their living costs on top of that. Scholarship opportunities in the UK at an undergraduate level are almost non-existent, with most universities offering around GBP 3,000 to 7,000 at best, and full tuition or full-ride scholarships being limited to a handful of slots at top colleges with hyper-competitive ratios of acceptance. The rising costs of tuition at many of these universities are not going to be conducive to attracting more international students either. Rahmin*, a 12th-grade student hoping to go abroad for her studies this fall, says, ""I wanted to go to the UK because their focus on a purely academic education really appeals to me. However, even with very good grades, I don't believe I would have been able to secure the few scholarships that are available in the UK. They are simply too competitive and, unlike the US, there are no need-based scholarships available for international students. My parents would have had to sell off whatever meagre lands they own in their village to be able to even put me through just one year of studies in the UK, particularly with the rising cost of attendance for degrees in the biomedical fields.""  Despite its seemingly attractive need-based scholarships, the US has not been particularly kind to Bangladeshi students either. ""While the number of student visa acceptances has increased, the ratio has decreased. I believe more than 70,000 Bangladeshi students applied last year but only around 14,000 visas were granted. Students are not being able to get visa appointment slots, with many getting dates in 2026,"" remarks Anindya. Quazi Fuad, who was initially supposed to attend Arizona State University, says, ""I tried to get a visa interview several times but failed. I finally gave up and chose to come to Australia."" It is no surprise that admissions to top American colleges are becoming exponentially more difficult by the day. Tauhid Islam Jami, an incoming freshman at Lafayette College, speaks at length about this, ""The number of US applicants has increased drastically in the last few years, making it all the more competitive. Not just that, while the expected family contribution for an average aid-seeking applicant in the past might have been around USD 15,000, it has now risen to USD 25,000. Institutions are not just looking for students who have better, more holistic, and more unique profiles; they are also looking for applicants who have more money."" Soumya Suvra Das, a 20-year-old applicant, brings up a different point. ""President Trump's policies have been nothing short of lunacy so far and the US seems to be headed towards becoming a conservative and capitalistic swamp. This is making me uncertain about a future there and sceptical of my decision to apply.""  Germany, once a rather popular study abroad option for students looking to get affordable, high-class education, is losing its appeal too. For Sajid Al Irfan Riaz, a first-year undergraduate student at the Islamic University of Technology, studying Mechanical Engineering in Germany was a childhood dream. However, once he was nearing the end of his high school years and started looking into Germany, he was hit by a terribly harsh reality check. ""The official waiting period for German student visas is officially 25 months, give or take three or four months. This has been rising over the past few years. I could not afford to sit around for that long to start my bachelor's. Albeit, for scholarship receivers, there is no waiting period,"" says Sajid. Md Emon Shaikh is a student pursuing a Combined Bachelor's in Engineering and Management at Hochschule Merseburg and Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. He says, ""As a bachelor's applicant, I had to apply for an appointment at the German embassy after completing my first year of undergraduate studies. This is because Germany requires Bangladeshi students to have 13 years of education. However, I had to wait for a long time and only received my appointment in my fourth year of university. Due to this delay, I had to arrange various documents proving my student status, including my second- and third-year results."" Moreover, the blocked account requirement – the amount that German authorities require international students to deposit in a special bank account for expenses in Germany per academic year – was also changed recently. In 2020, the blocked account amount needed to be EUR 10,236. This rose to EUR 11,904 in 2024 – a nearly 17 percent increase. Emon says, ""As a student from a middle-class family, arranging the required funds was quite challenging for me. The amount – almost BDT 16 lakh – was a significant sum of money for us. However, I managed to arrange it by selling land and taking loans from the bank and relatives."" While certainly not conventional, more and more Bangladeshi students have been opting for countries like Finland and Hong Kong for their undergraduate degrees in recent times. However, with Finnish universities introducing an application fee of EUR 100 where it previously used to be free of charge, institutions like Aalto University raising their tuition fees across a range of disciplines and creating new, narrower criteria for scholarships, and the cumbersome situation with Indian visa refusals (as the Finnish Embassy, where students have to receive their residence permits from, is located in India), Finland might soon be out of reach for many Bangladeshi citizens. The near-absent job market for international students after their studies in Finland is also an additional factor to consider for those who might be hoping to settle abroad. Hong Kong, too, is becoming less lucrative. While many top universities in Hong Kong used to offer full funding for A level students with three A*s even a few years back, now the requirement has risen to four or five A*s, making admissions substantially more competitive. The housing situation in Hong Kong is also no longer ideal; many students face much uncertainty about receiving university housing after their first year and external housing is often too pricey. Hong Kong is one of the most expensive cities in the world for foreigners to live in, so without a reasonable scholarship, it might not be a good option for many Bangladeshi students.  There is no denying that studying abroad is becoming difficult for Bangladeshi students and their fates rest almost ubiquitously out of their hands. Students have to consider a variety of factors — escalating costs, increasing competition, limitations on student visas— before making a decision on where to apply. Looking into alternative options such as making the most of the educational opportunities within the country or finding affordable degrees in countries without these issues might be a good idea, particularly given the rising uncertainties surrounding the opportunities in countries that were once most favoured by Bangladeshis.

This is a substantial financial burden and it becomes difficult for many to show the required funds along with the tuitions for the first semester. International students have always been a strong source of income for Canadian universities, with most international students paying tuition fees six times the value of the tuition fees paid by Canadian citizens. There is speculation that higher education institutions in Canada will be raising their international tuition fees to counteract their losses from the reduced international student intakes, making it harder for many Bangladeshi students to be able to pay for a Canadian degree. Moreover, Canadian universities are notorious for their near-abysmal scholarship opportunities at the undergraduate level, so students can receive no reprieve from that end either.  Moreover, in the past two years, restrictions have been placed on work permits for spouses of international students. However, now there is also talk of post-graduation work permits (PGWPs) becoming more difficult for students themselves. Orchid expresses his concern in this regard, ""I believe the Canadian government will become stricter on the GPA requirements or the type of major you have before granting a PGWP in the future. This will negatively impact the chances of getting permanent residence (PR) in Canada for international students like me who want to settle here after graduation."" On the future of Bangladeshi students in Canada, Anindya says, ""Since the beginning of 2025, we have seen a rise in the proportion of study permit acceptances to Canada. However, that could be because fewer students have been applying to Canada to begin with, put off by the fear of harsh permit policies.""  Australia has been attempting to follow in the same vein. While there was some talk about the Australian government introducing a cap on the number of incoming international students from 2025, the bill was ultimately not passed but the authorities came back with a new visa processing structure in place of the cap. The new structure might, in turn, result in visa processing delays, with many students having to defer their enrolment.  What Australia may not have been able to do in the form of caps, it has done through a range of other measures already. Aranyo Rishi Chowdhury, a high school graduate who had been hoping to apply to Australian universities this year, explains the reasons behind his determent, ""Even though Australia was one of my top choices for pursuing my undergraduate degree, I was put off by the lacklustre scholarship opportunities available. With most meritorious students receiving a maximum of 40 percent scholarship, I simply couldn't afford Australia. I would have to work part-time jobs just to be able to pay off tuition and miss out on all other aspects of my university life."" Not only has the Australian government raised the minimum IELTS score requirement for a student visa from 5.5 to 6, they doubled the student visa application fee from AUD 710  to AUD 1,600 and increased the proof of savings from AUD 24,505 to AUD 29,710 in 2024. This, coupled with the post-pandemic reductions in scholarship opportunities, is certainly discouraging for Bangladeshi students, many of whom can't afford the nearly ostentatious costs of attendance at Australian universities without multiple part-time jobs.  Australia's relatively new Genuine Student Test, as part of their visa interview process, has also been a step the country has taken to curb the number of fraudulent students entering the country just to work low-wage jobs. Quazi Fuad, an incoming freshman at the University of New South Wales, highlights the hurdles he faced with this addition, ""I had to write my answers for the Genuine Student Test twice, because my answers weren't good enough, and my agent ultimately ended up having to help me with it."" Additionally, the increasing emphasis on practical, professional degrees and a move away from the humanities and social sciences in countries like Australia and the United Kingdom has meant that universities are subtly discouraging students from studying these subjects which can be a strong negative for students interested in the humanities.  On the UK scene, Anindya comments, ""The UK, as a study abroad destination, has become drastically less popular over the past two years because of the restrictions on spouse visas. For those hoping to take their close ones on a dependent visa, recent restrictions have certainly been a massive blow."" International student tuition fees in the UK start from around GBP 13,000 and the average cost would be around GBP 20,000, and students have to carry their living costs on top of that. Scholarship opportunities in the UK at an undergraduate level are almost non-existent, with most universities offering around GBP 3,000 to 7,000 at best, and full tuition or full-ride scholarships being limited to a handful of slots at top colleges with hyper-competitive ratios of acceptance. The rising costs of tuition at many of these universities are not going to be conducive to attracting more international students either. Rahmin*, a 12th-grade student hoping to go abroad for her studies this fall, says, ""I wanted to go to the UK because their focus on a purely academic education really appeals to me. However, even with very good grades, I don't believe I would have been able to secure the few scholarships that are available in the UK. They are simply too competitive and, unlike the US, there are no need-based scholarships available for international students. My parents would have had to sell off whatever meagre lands they own in their village to be able to even put me through just one year of studies in the UK, particularly with the rising cost of attendance for degrees in the biomedical fields.""  Despite its seemingly attractive need-based scholarships, the US has not been particularly kind to Bangladeshi students either. ""While the number of student visa acceptances has increased, the ratio has decreased. I believe more than 70,000 Bangladeshi students applied last year but only around 14,000 visas were granted. Students are not being able to get visa appointment slots, with many getting dates in 2026,"" remarks Anindya. Quazi Fuad, who was initially supposed to attend Arizona State University, says, ""I tried to get a visa interview several times but failed. I finally gave up and chose to come to Australia."" It is no surprise that admissions to top American colleges are becoming exponentially more difficult by the day. Tauhid Islam Jami, an incoming freshman at Lafayette College, speaks at length about this, ""The number of US applicants has increased drastically in the last few years, making it all the more competitive. Not just that, while the expected family contribution for an average aid-seeking applicant in the past might have been around USD 15,000, it has now risen to USD 25,000. Institutions are not just looking for students who have better, more holistic, and more unique profiles; they are also looking for applicants who have more money."" Soumya Suvra Das, a 20-year-old applicant, brings up a different point. ""President Trump's policies have been nothing short of lunacy so far and the US seems to be headed towards becoming a conservative and capitalistic swamp. This is making me uncertain about a future there and sceptical of my decision to apply.""  Germany, once a rather popular study abroad option for students looking to get affordable, high-class education, is losing its appeal too. For Sajid Al Irfan Riaz, a first-year undergraduate student at the Islamic University of Technology, studying Mechanical Engineering in Germany was a childhood dream. However, once he was nearing the end of his high school years and started looking into Germany, he was hit by a terribly harsh reality check. ""The official waiting period for German student visas is officially 25 months, give or take three or four months. This has been rising over the past few years. I could not afford to sit around for that long to start my bachelor's. Albeit, for scholarship receivers, there is no waiting period,"" says Sajid. Md Emon Shaikh is a student pursuing a Combined Bachelor's in Engineering and Management at Hochschule Merseburg and Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. He says, ""As a bachelor's applicant, I had to apply for an appointment at the German embassy after completing my first year of undergraduate studies. This is because Germany requires Bangladeshi students to have 13 years of education. However, I had to wait for a long time and only received my appointment in my fourth year of university. Due to this delay, I had to arrange various documents proving my student status, including my second- and third-year results."" Moreover, the blocked account requirement – the amount that German authorities require international students to deposit in a special bank account for expenses in Germany per academic year – was also changed recently. In 2020, the blocked account amount needed to be EUR 10,236. This rose to EUR 11,904 in 2024 – a nearly 17 percent increase. Emon says, ""As a student from a middle-class family, arranging the required funds was quite challenging for me. The amount – almost BDT 16 lakh – was a significant sum of money for us. However, I managed to arrange it by selling land and taking loans from the bank and relatives."" While certainly not conventional, more and more Bangladeshi students have been opting for countries like Finland and Hong Kong for their undergraduate degrees in recent times. However, with Finnish universities introducing an application fee of EUR 100 where it previously used to be free of charge, institutions like Aalto University raising their tuition fees across a range of disciplines and creating new, narrower criteria for scholarships, and the cumbersome situation with Indian visa refusals (as the Finnish Embassy, where students have to receive their residence permits from, is located in India), Finland might soon be out of reach for many Bangladeshi citizens. The near-absent job market for international students after their studies in Finland is also an additional factor to consider for those who might be hoping to settle abroad. Hong Kong, too, is becoming less lucrative. While many top universities in Hong Kong used to offer full funding for A level students with three A*s even a few years back, now the requirement has risen to four or five A*s, making admissions substantially more competitive. The housing situation in Hong Kong is also no longer ideal; many students face much uncertainty about receiving university housing after their first year and external housing is often too pricey. Hong Kong is one of the most expensive cities in the world for foreigners to live in, so without a reasonable scholarship, it might not be a good option for many Bangladeshi students.  There is no denying that studying abroad is becoming difficult for Bangladeshi students and their fates rest almost ubiquitously out of their hands. Students have to consider a variety of factors — escalating costs, increasing competition, limitations on student visas— before making a decision on where to apply. Looking into alternative options such as making the most of the educational opportunities within the country or finding affordable degrees in countries without these issues might be a good idea, particularly given the rising uncertainties surrounding the opportunities in countries that were once most favoured by Bangladeshis.

57,Bangladeshi researchers at Shanghai Ocean University mark breakthrough in fish species,https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/bangladeshi-researchers-shanghai-ocean-university-mark-breakthrough-fish-species-3839596, ,"A joint team of researchers from Shanghai Ocean University and Jagannath University in Bangladesh recently unveiled three groundbreaking research findings on Hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha), a flagship species in Bangladesh and its national fish, marking a new milestone of international cooperation in the species' study, management and protection. These breakthroughs were made by three Bangladeshi researchers, namely Md Rashedur Rahman, Kishor Kumar Sarke and Anirban Sarker, all of whom are PhD graduates from the Lab of Molecular Systematics and Ecology of Shanghai Ocean University. Their research mainly focuses on three landmark studies on Hilsa shad, including its sex reversal, whole genome sequencing, and population genomics. Notably among them, Rahman, who completed his PhD in Shanghai and returned to his own nation in December, has for the first time proved the sex change phenomenon in Hilsa shad. Through biological and histological analyses on 203 samples from six regions including the Padma River, Meghna River and the Bay of Bengal, his research revealed that this species undergoes protandrous hermaphroditism, meaning individuals transition from male to female at a certain stage of their life cycle. This discovery provides critical insights into the apparent scarcity of male Hilsa, which has long puzzled researchers and fisheries managers, and provides an important scientific basis for understanding the complete life cycle, reproductive strategies, and sexual transition mechanisms of shad. ""The Hilsa shad, a flagship species in Bangladesh, holds immense economic and ecological value. These findings not only deepen our understanding of the biological characteristics of the Hilsa shad but also provide a scientific foundation for the conservation and sustainable management of this critically important species,"" said Huang Xuxiong, executive deputy dean of the College of Fisheries and Life Science at Shanghai Ocean University, at a news briefing on Feb 27. Li Chenhong, a professor at Shanghai Ocean University and supervisor of the lab, pointed out that the research findings are the results of nearly 10 years of hard work made by three classes of Bangladeshi students in countless days and nights.

59,The relationship between consumerism and the climate crisis: Explained ,https://www.thedailystar.net/rising-stars/explained/news/the-relationship-between-consumerism-and-the-climate-crisis-explained-3834996,References Punomi Rahman Titir is a contributor at The Daily Star.

At the time, these lessons seemed simple acts of gratitude passed down through generations. I never questioned them further. Little did I know, the world around me was moving in the opposite direction, encouraging the endless pursuit of more: more food, more clothes, more gadgets — most of which we do not need. Over the past few decades, the world has undergone an upsurge in production and consumption rates. Consumer-driven systems have staggered unprecedented growth and transformed global economies, driven by industrial development and an insatiable appetite for goods and services. However, our desire for convenience and abundance remains in direct conflict with the planet's call for stability. Modern consumerism thrives on an endless cycle of production, consumption, and disposal. The average person now encounters between 6,000 to 10,000 advertisements every single day, constantly nudging them towards the next purchase. With more than 1.7 billion people of the global population set to join the 'consumer class', the drive to acquire goods beyond basic necessities continues to grow. To compete against relentless consumer demands, industries exploit natural resources at unsustainable rates, depleting forests, water reserves, and fossil fuels. The cycle exacerbates the waste crisis with non-biodegradable materials filling up landfills and polluting natural habitats. This, in turn, not only affects the environment but also disrupts the Earth's functional integrity. Human activities are pushing the planet's natural systems beyond safe and sustainable limits. These limits, known as Earth-system boundaries (ESBs), are at critical thresholds that ensure the stability of the planet's life-support systems. In other words, they define a safe operating space for humanity that cannot be exceeded if rapid and catastrophic environmental change is to be avoided. Alarmingly, seven of these eight planetary boundaries, including those related to climate, biodiversity, and freshwater use, have already been breached. According to statistics, the top 10 percent of global consumers are responsible for 31–67 percent of planetary boundary transgressions, with the top 20 percent accounting between 51–91 percent, spanning both developed and developing countries. Recognising the outsized role of the world's wealthiest consumers in exceeding these limits, researchers have proposed six scenarios aimed at reducing environmental impact. One approach suggests that top percentage of global consumers align their consumption levels with those of the same percentile of the total global population. Another strategy emphasises improving efficiency by adopting the most environmentally friendly consumption practices already observed within their group. A more comprehensive approach combines both strategies, urging affluent consumers to reduce overall consumption and promote sustainable consumption patterns. These findings support the idea of a 'safe and just corridor' — a balance between environmental sustainability and social fairness. A safe system ensures the Earth remains stable, while a just system ensures resources are shared equitably, meeting essential needs like food, water, and energy. The corridor's upper limit is defined by the need to prevent ecological collapse, while its foundation ensures that no one is deprived of basic necessities. However, simply staying within these boundaries is not enough, resources must also be fairly distributed to prevent inequality and environmental harm. Achieving this requires procedural and substantive justice, ensuring fair decision-making and equitable access to sustainable opportunities. A recent study by the Earth Commission estimates the resource access needs for the global population to thrive, along with their potential impacts on Earth's systems. Unfortunately, the results suggest that even if everyone in the world lives with only the bare minimum of resources required, the safe and just climate boundaries are likely to be overshot by 2050 without radical changes in energy and food systems. This, in turn, heightens the likelihood of disease outbreaks, natural disasters, and even conflicts over scarce resources. Vulnerable populations in low-income regions bear the brunt of climate injustice, despite contributing the least to the climate crisis. Therefore, due to a profound imbalance in responsibility and exposure, the actions of leading nations and individuals disproportionately drive the degradation of shared natural systems. To achieve a fair and sustainable future, transformative changes will be required in how societies function. Industries must shift towards renewable production methods, prioritising efficiency and reducing waste. Governments need to implement taxation on excessive consumption, regulate harmful practices, and ensure fair distribution of resources. Cities and businesses, as significant contributors to environmental impacts, can adopt science-based targets to reduce emissions and foster innovations that minimise their ecological footprints. The path forward requires global cooperation and a shared commitment to protecting both the planet and its people. The evidence is clear: unless we address the unsustainable patterns of consumerism and resource exploitation, the planet's ability to support life will continue to decline.

60,"Manikganj youth builds aircraft, flies it",https://www.thedailystar.net/youth/news/manikganj-youth-builds-aircraft-flies-it-3839651, ,"With determination and hard work, even the most difficult tasks become possible. A young man from Manikganj has demonstrated this by building his own aeroplane and successfully flying it. Julhas Molla, 28, of Shaitghar Teota village in Shibaloy upazila, flew his self-made aircraft this afternoon on the banks of the Jamuna river in the Jafarganj area. The deputy commissioner, along with senior officials from the district and upazila administration, attended the event, while thousands of curious locals gathered to witness the flight. Julhas's father, Jalil Molla, originally hailed from the Baghutia area of Daulatpur upazila. However, due to river erosion, the family relocated to Shaitghar Teota. Julhas, the fifth of six brothers and two sisters, completed his SSC from Jionpur BKS High School but could not pursue further education due to financial constraints. An electrician by profession, he works on a contract basis in various institutions in Dhaka and spent his weekly holidays building the aircraft. According to Julhas, he conducted three years of research and spent another year constructing the aircraft, with a total cost of around Tk 8 lakh. The structure is made of aluminium and iron, and it is powered by a seven-horsepower water pump engine. He said the aircraft was built primarily for experimental training rather than commercial purposes. However, with government funding and sponsorship, commercial production could be possible. The aircraft can reach an altitude of over 50 feet. Deputy Commissioner Manowar Hossain Molla said the government would support Julhas's research. While acknowledging the technical complexities involved, he said initial financial assistance had been provided to encourage his efforts. With determination and hard work, even the most difficult tasks become possible. A young man from Manikganj has demonstrated this by building his own aeroplane and successfully flying it. Julhas Molla, 28, of Shaitghar Teota village in Shibaloy upazila, flew his self-made aircraft this afternoon on the banks of the Jamuna river in the Jafarganj area. The deputy commissioner, along with senior officials from the district and upazila administration, attended the event, while thousands of curious locals gathered to witness the flight. Julhas's father, Jalil Molla, originally hailed from the Baghutia area of Daulatpur upazila. However, due to river erosion, the family relocated to Shaitghar Teota. Julhas, the fifth of six brothers and two sisters, completed his SSC from Jionpur BKS High School but could not pursue further education due to financial constraints. An electrician by profession, he works on a contract basis in various institutions in Dhaka and spent his weekly holidays building the aircraft. According to Julhas, he conducted three years of research and spent another year constructing the aircraft, with a total cost of around Tk 8 lakh. The structure is made of aluminium and iron, and it is powered by a seven-horsepower water pump engine. He said the aircraft was built primarily for experimental training rather than commercial purposes. However, with government funding and sponsorship, commercial production could be possible.

62,What it takes to run an online handmade jewellery business as a young entrepreneur,https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/campus/news/what-it-takes-run-online-handmade-jewellery-business-young-entrepreneur-3839436, ,"Contrary to what many may presume, running an online handmade jewellery business requires consistent effort and commitment. In Bangladesh, the online jewellery scene is thriving with the growing popularity of social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, where handmade jewellery is being sold and promoted. And behind every well-crafted jewellery page is a story that incorporates courage to begin, a painstaking creative process, survival in a competitive market, and a desire to leave a footprint in the field of online business.  A natural question that propels the curious mind is how the artisans behind these wonderful creations found the inspiration to start their journey.  Syeda Tithila Manjur, owner of Layes Fita, says that the initial idea behind the business stemmed from her childhood game of decorating her dolls. She states, ""Back in my childhood, I used to make dolls' jewellery from beads, and that is where I got my first inspiration to make handmade jewellery. Since then, I have wanted to work in this field."" Similar to Tithila, Afrin Parvez, owner of the page Little Creations by Afrin, has harboured an interest in this work since her early days, but she could only translate her interest into reality during the COVID-19 lockdown. It is important to emphasise that for both individuals, starting their journey was not a sudden decision. Rather, it was the realisation of a long-nurtured dream, characterised by passion and a genuine love for the craft, that manifested into reality only when it felt right. When asked about what made them open their business in a virtual space instead of a physical one, different entrepreneurs had different reasons. For Tithila it was pure coincidence. She shares, ""Once I just uploaded some pictures of my work to share with my friends. Surprisingly, I got some orders from those works, and thus I started my journey."" In contrast to Tithila, Afrin felt it was the manageability of the online platforms that made her start her business online instead of in a physical store. She states, ""An online page is easy to manage from any place."" One thing to observe is that, unlike a physical business, an online business requires comparatively less investment. The flexibility, in terms of time commitment, of the online medium is also note-worthy. These aspects have made the online platform an attractive opportunity for many hesitant entrepreneurs who might have a different primary commitment but want to manage a successful business. With more and more handmade jewellery shops cropping up on our feeds every day, securing quality materials can make or break an online handmade jewellery business, especially when designs are unique and intricate. Sadia shares, ""Sourcing from the right places was quite challenging. Sometimes we source raw materials from abroad through importers and some materials are sourced domestically. Mirpur 1, for example, is a good place for buying wholesale. Using my own design and aesthetic, I transform these materials into jewellery in my unique style."" Mownita Ahmed, owner of the online page Mownita's, relies on accessible resources, choosing art and craft stores for sourcing. This reflects the determination of small-scale entrepreneurs who must maximize what is available to them. Local stores are a simple solution for sourcing raw materials, especially for those who don't have access to large suppliers. Mownita's journey also highlights the hurdles that come with starting a business with limited resources. ""Having little to no money to invest in a business as a student and also having no basic knowledge of art was the real problem for me. I used my pocket money, which was only BDT 10 to 20 at that time, as an investment, bought some raw materials, and instantly started my business with only one hand-painted designer jewellery piece,"" she shares. For new entrepreneurs like her, starting with minimal capital and learning on the go is often the only option. However, this entrepreneurial spirit of making do with what's available can serve as an inspiration for others who have limited capital and experience but a strong desire to create. Marketing is an added hurdle that small online businesses face. ""Facebook was actually my first platform for marketing. Now, I also work with several local initiative-based organisations for marketing,"" explains Sadia. Mownita takes a different approach and relies on customer trust and loyalty. She says, ""I think trust can be the biggest marketing strategy nowadays. Every one of my loyal clients market my products."" This organic form of marketing shows the importance of small-scale online businesses building genuine relationships with customers, especially in an industry where word-of-mouth can influence sales. Every creative job is draining due to the pressure of maintaining novelty. Upon being asked how she deals with this challenge, Afrin says she frequently explores different media of art, which allows her to gain new insight. She says, ""Working with different media and changing media help me diversify my designs."" Speaking on how to overcome creative challenges and keep moving forward as a new business owner, Mownita shares, ""Art needs persistence, not perfection. Use your imagination and authentically express yourself. The right client will love you for your work. It will be difficult in the beginning, but stay resourceful, and eventually, you will have a fulfilling and successful business.""

63,The enduring presence of cats in Japanese literature,https://www.thedailystar.net/rising-stars/interests/news/the-enduring-presence-cats-japanese-literature-3834991,"Adrin Sarwar is a writer, a student of Printing and Publications and an illustrator. You can reach her at  Adrin Sarwar is a writer, a student of Printing and Publications and an illustrator. You can reach her at   ","What's with all the cats in Japanese literature? In the few books I have read, one thing has grabbed my attention again and again—the presence of feline characters, especially cats, on the covers. Most people will be amazed to find that Japanese literature has a whole history and cultural rundown behind this significant presence of cats in their literature. From the world's first novel,  , from the eleventh century to the contemporary famous novel  , cats have always been a significant element of Japanese literature. Japanese writers use the motif of cats for different rhetoric purposes, often putting them at the centre of the story. Sometimes the stories are told from a cat's perspective. In  , for example, Natsume Soseki sheds light upon life in the Meiji period through social commentary by a cat. In many Japanese stories, cats are presented as guides or companions to human characters. In these stories, the cats often help the human characters with loneliness or emotional fulfilment.   by Hiro Arikawa tells the story of Nana, a young and spirited cat, and his gentle human companion, Satoru, as they journey together on a mysterious road trip across Japan and discover the true meaning of love, courage, and everything in between. The cats help the human characters confront difficult truths about life, death, and human nature. Although these lessons may be delivered in a comical manner, they are poignant. In   by Sosuke Natsukawa, readers are introduced to Rintaro Natsuki, a young man struggling with loneliness and grief. After his grandfather passes away and the family's beloved second-hand bookshop is set to close, Rintaro's world is turned upside down by the arrival of a talking tabby cat named Tiger. With a sharp tongue and plenty of attitude, Tiger gives Rintaro an unusual mission: to save books from being lost forever. As they set off on a series of magical and heartwarming adventures, Tiger acts as both a guide and a mentor, helping Rintaro find his way out of grief and loneliness. In the works of Haruki Murakami, one of Japan's most celebrated authors, cats take on a different kind of role. Rather than being just moral guides, these mysterious felines appear as recurring characters in novels like  ,  , and  . In Murakami's world, cats aren't simply companions to humans; they serve as catalysts that launch his characters into strange and often surreal adventures. These enigmatic cats add to the magical and mysterious atmosphere that is a hallmark of Murakami's storytelling. The symbolism of cats in Japanese literature is deeply rooted in their culture. In Japan, cats are considered to be a symbol of good luck and fortune. Most of these portrayals of cats are drawn from the familiar, comforting presence of house cats. Japanese legends also show the impact of cats on human life. From the very beginning, cats, with their quirky and mysterious nature, have been enduring characters in Japanese literature. Combine that with the deep affection the Japanese have for these animals, and it's easy to see why cats are such compelling figures. They make fascinating characters and serve as excellent companions and wise guides in the stories that explore life's many adventures.

64,,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/food-recipes/news/why-jilapi-the-undisputed-king-iftar-delights-3837771, ,"Jilapi remains an iftar essential, cherished for its crispy, syrupy delight. From street vendors to fine dining, its nostalgic charm unites generations. Whether classic or gourmet, this Ramadan staple continues to reign supreme, bringing joy with every golden swirl. Photo: Collected / Mumtahina Tanni / Pexels Ji-La-Pi or Jalebi — call it whatever you want; this crispy, sweet snack doesn't need a fancy introduction. Some make it extra crispy; some make it syrupy enough to put honey to shame, and some go full freestyle with shapes that defy geometry. From the fine dining tables of Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel, where it's elevated to a culinary masterpiece, to the bustling streets of Puran Dhaka, where the local vendor swears by their ""secret recipe"" (which is probably just more sugar), the quest for the perfect jilapi is getting intense! But hey, are we complaining? Absolutely not! Because no matter where it's from, this golden, syrup-drenched swirl never fails to steal the show at any iftar gathering. And with   in full swing, we are here to offend the endocrinologists once again and shine the spotlight on this undisputed Godfather of all iftar items! So, have you ever thought about what makes jilapi such an integral part of Ramadan? And why do people hoard it in ridiculous amounts, as if it's the secret to eternal happiness? Let's hear from the true jilapi aficionados! ""I don't care what's on the iftar table, as long as there's jilapi,"" says Biva, a university student from Dhanmondi. ""The moment I take my first bite with muri makha (puffed rice salad), I feel like all the fasting struggles were worth it. It's a necessity for me."" Biva loves the chikon jilapi (the thin variant) deep-fried in ghee (clarified butter) from Ananda Bakery in Jigatola. Emdad Hossain, a college teacher, reminisces, ""Jilapi isn't just a snack; it's a sweet spiral of memories for me. Growing up in Puran Dhaka, it was always there — after Jumma prayers, at a milad, on the iftar table, or simply over endless cups of tea with friends after Taraweeh prayer. One bite of chikon jilapi, and I'm right back in those carefree days."" With a chuckle, he adds, ""Even now, despite my diabetes, chikon jilapi still finds a place on my iftar table. My wife does her best to keep it away from me, but every now and then, I manage to sneak in a piece — disappointing both my doctor and my wife in one go!"" Meanwhile, Shuvroto Kanchan, a businessman, doesn't just love jilapi — he's on a sugary expedition! Whether it's the royal Shahi Jilapi from Chawk bazar or the silky Reshmi Jilapi from Mithaiwala, he devours them all with equal passion. But when it comes to favourites, his heart (and taste buds) belongs to Mithaiwala's Rabri Jilapi. For the past two Ramadans, Shuvroto Kanchan has been treating himself to Rabri Jilapi — not just as a dessert, but as gym motivation! Yes, you heard that right! While most people reward their workouts with protein shakes, he prefers a sugar-soaked incentive. As he puts it, ""This rabri jilapi keeps me motivated to hit the gym, even in Ramadan!"" Jilapi for fitness? Hey, whatever keeps Shuvroto's treadmill running! We are not judging! However, his wife has pledged loyalty to Khazana Mithai's Zafran Jilapi, a saffron-infused delight fit for a queen. And just when we thought the family's jilapi saga couldn't get any sweeter, his daughter chimes in with her love for their Chana Jilapi! With a chuckle, Kanchan says, ""Our household doesn't just have a sweet tooth; we have a whole sweet jaw!"" ""My grandfather always brought fresh jilapi during Ramadan from a low-key shop on Mohammadpur's Salimullah Road. It's a must-have. Iftar just doesn't feel right without it,"" says Tanveer, a banker from Mohammadpur. In many of Dhaka's households, the iftar table isn't truly complete unless there's a pile of jilapi, thin or thick, glistening golden under the lights. It's expected, anticipated, and honestly, non-negotiable. ""I still remember how I used to get this dopamine rush while watching the street vendors swirl the batter into hot oil with effortless precision; the whole process felt like magic to me as a kid. It's steeped in my memories. And then, my grandfather would sometimes bring gurer jilapi — dipped in molasses instead of syrup, a rare treat that I'd show off to my friends like a badge of honour,"" adds Tanveer. So, whether you like it crispy, juicy, oversized, or bite-sized — one thing is certain: Ramadan wouldn't be the same without it. Even with new food trends emerging like cheese-stuffed samosas, chocolate-covered dates, or other gourmet iftar platters — jilapi's place still remains untouchable! And we think that's why people hoard it in ridiculous amounts, because it is indeed a secret coil to eternal happiness! Ji-La-Pi or Jalebi — call it whatever you want; this crispy, sweet snack doesn't need a fancy introduction. Some make it extra crispy; some make it syrupy enough to put honey to shame, and some go full freestyle with shapes that defy geometry. From the fine dining tables of Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel, where it's elevated to a culinary masterpiece, to the bustling streets of Puran Dhaka, where the local vendor swears by their ""secret recipe"" (which is probably just more sugar), the quest for the perfect jilapi is getting intense! But hey, are we complaining? Absolutely not! Because no matter where it's from, this golden, syrup-drenched swirl never fails to steal the show at any iftar gathering. And with   in full swing, we are here to offend the endocrinologists once again and shine the spotlight on this undisputed Godfather of all iftar items! So, have you ever thought about what makes jilapi such an integral part of Ramadan? And why do people hoard it in ridiculous amounts, as if it's the secret to eternal happiness? Let's hear from the true jilapi aficionados! ""I don't care what's on the iftar table, as long as there's jilapi,"" says Biva, a university student from Dhanmondi. ""The moment I take my first bite with muri makha (puffed rice salad), I feel like all the fasting struggles were worth it. It's a necessity for me."" Biva loves the chikon jilapi (the thin variant) deep-fried in ghee (clarified butter) from Ananda Bakery in Jigatola. Emdad Hossain, a college teacher, reminisces, ""Jilapi isn't just a snack; it's a sweet spiral of memories for me. Growing up in Puran Dhaka, it was always there — after Jumma prayers, at a milad, on the iftar table, or simply over endless cups of tea with friends after Taraweeh prayer. One bite of chikon jilapi, and I'm right back in those carefree days."" With a chuckle, he adds, ""Even now, despite my diabetes, chikon jilapi still finds a place on my iftar table. My wife does her best to keep it away from me, but every now and then, I manage to sneak in a piece — disappointing both my doctor and my wife in one go!""

Photo: Collected / Eric Nopanen / Unsplash In the mid-2000s, Bangladesh's radio landscape was barren.   was virtually non-existent, and the idea of a youth-centric station seemed far-fetched. That was until Daniel Rahman stepped in, unknowingly setting the foundation for one of the country's most iconic youth brands, Radio Foorti. We got a chance to sit down with him to learn more about how the brand came to be, its role in shaping Bangladeshi culture, the decline of radio and his passion for the music industry. For Daniel Rahman, radio was never the plan. ""My journey into radio happened in a rather unexpected way,"" he recalls. In 2006, MGH Group secured one of the first FM radio licenses in Bangladesh, and sought expert advice from India's Radio Mirchi. They were told to find someone who was deeply immersed in Dhaka's cultural scene; someone socially connected and musically inclined. ""Surprisingly, I met all these criteria,"" Daniel says. ""At the time, I was still in university, with no concrete plans to enter the radio industry. But since they were actively looking for such a person, I found myself becoming a part of it. It all happened organically, without prior planning."" Once at the helm of Radio Foorti, Daniel had a clear vision; to create a brand that truly represented Bangladeshi youth. ""Back then, brands targeting young people often felt too Westernised or carried Indian influences,"" he explains. ""A prime example is the portrayal of youth and their culture in television commercials at the time, which didn't truly resonate with the actual young population. I wanted to change that."" The first step was to come up with a name that was unmistakably Bangladeshi and also captured the essence of being young: 'Foorti,' the Bengali word for fun, was the perfect choice. Music, of course, was the backbone of Radio Foorti, but he also wanted the station to reflect everyday youth experiences. ""Traditional elements like Pahela Boishakh, pitha, mela, Rabindra Sangeet, and classical dance, while valuable, weren't what the youth deeply connected with. Instead, they resonated more with eating fuchka, jhalmuri, hanging out at tea stalls or tong as they are more popularly known, adda mara, and rickshaw rides,"" he says. ""As someone who was young myself at the time, these were the experiences I related to as well."" By crafting a brand that spoke directly to the youth, Radio Foorti quickly became a cultural phenomenon. ""We redefined what it meant to be young and Bangladeshi, moving beyond conventional cultural portrayals and embracing a more authentic identity. That's why Radio Foorti became a cultural icon from the moment it launched."" Despite his success, Daniel acknowledges that creating youth-focused brands in Bangladesh remains a challenge. ""By 2009-10, Radio Foorti had established itself as one of the standout youth brands, and even in 2025, only a handful of brands have managed to achieve that level of connection,"" he notes. One of the key issues, he explains, is how brands are built. ""Many ad agencies and brand developers have a rigid, outdated perception of what 'youth' means. But to successfully capture the youth market, you need to deeply understand their emotions, aspirations, struggles, and even their slang. Brands often rely on clichés rather than genuinely engaging with young people."" He stresses that youth culture is constantly evolving, especially in the age of TikTok, making it even harder to keep up. ""Staying relevant requires constant adaptation, something many brands fail to do."" While Radio Foorti flourished in its prime, the broader radio industry has struggled in recent years. ""Radio's decline isn't unique to Bangladesh, it's a global phenomenon,"" Daniel explains. ""The internet has disrupted not just radio, but also newspapers and television. However, radio's downfall happened more rapidly because the industry stopped innovating at a critical juncture."" He believes that many radio stations became complacent, assuming their audiences would remain loyal. ""Once money starts flowing in, the urgency to innovate diminishes. But with the rise of the internet and social media, radio stations found themselves competing on a global scale. When content wasn't compelling enough, listeners simply moved on to better alternatives."" So, does radio have a future in Bangladesh? According to Daniel, it does, but only if drastic changes are made. ""The only way forward is to embrace digital transformation. Radio can no longer function as just 'radio', it needs to become a more integrated media platform with strong video elements and an interactive online presence."" However, he admits, ""I don't see many efforts being made to capitalise on this potential. Unless drastic changes happen, the industry will continue to fade."" Beyond radio, Daniel has always been passionate about the Bangladeshi music industry, which is actually one of the contributing factors of Radio Foorti's immense success. ""During my time in radio, which was up until the pandemic, my main focus was always on musicians. I believed that the more musicians we nurtured, the more stars we created, and in turn, the more radio thrived."" He made it a point to support artists, regardless of their status. ""My policy was simple; whether you were a legend or a bathroom singer, my door was always open. Send me your demo! Many now-successful musicians and bands got their first break because I loved their music and played it on my radio."" Today, he sees a lack of people willing to take similar initiatives. ""The industry suffers because people are too focused on their own interests rather than the bigger picture. This self-centred mindset is one of the saddest aspects of Bangladeshi culture and it really stops things from growing"" However, he remains hopeful. ""If more people prioritised the music scene itself, supporting up-and-coming artists instead of just pushing their own agenda, the industry could reach incredible heights. Who knows, maybe I'll step back into the industry someday to help make that happen."" From shaping the voice of Bangladeshi youth to championing local musicians, Daniel Rahman's influence on the country's cultural landscape is undeniable. His journey, though unplanned, has left an enduring mark, proving that true innovation comes from understanding and embracing the essence of a generation.

In Bangladesh, a country rich in biodiversity, yet rapidly urbanising, conservation efforts are more crucial than ever.  Photo: Joyeeta Trisha Every year on 3 March, the world celebrates World Wildlife Day to raise awareness about protecting animals. In Bangladesh, a country rich in biodiversity, yet rapidly urbanising, conservation efforts are more crucial than ever. While much attention is given to endangered species in forests and rivers, a vital but often overlooked part of our ecosystem — stray animals and urban wildlife — also deserves recognition. From street dogs and cats to urban birds and reptiles, these creatures play a key role in maintaining ecological balance, but often face neglect and mistreatment. Incidents like the poisoning of several stray dogs and a cat in Mohammadpur's Japan Garden City, where the animals tragically died after consuming poisoned food, highlight the cruelty that these animals face. Additionally, in another heart-breaking incident, a man was seen kicking a helpless cat to death in Mohammadpur, further highlighting the cruelty faced by stray animals. A case was filed in a Dhaka court, regarding the death of the cat in Mohammadpur, on 1 February, under the Animal Welfare Act, 2019. These recent incidents illustrate the growing cruelty toward stray animals, but legal actions are being taken to address such issues. At the same time, human-wildlife conflicts are becoming more frequent, with heart-breaking incidents like elephants being killed after wandering into villages in search of food. The struggle to enforce wildlife protection laws remains, but grassroots efforts and growing awareness among local communities offer hope for a more sustainable future. Bangladesh is home to a diverse range of wildlife, including Asian elephants, Bengal tigers, river dolphins, and countless bird species. However, habitat destruction, poaching, human-wildlife conflict, and weak law enforcement pose severe threats to their survival. The rapid loss of forests due to deforestation, illegal land grabbing, and unplanned urbanisation has pushed many wild animals into closer contact with humans, often leading to deadly consequences. In February 2025, an elephant was found dead in Cox's Bazar, suspected to have been killed by an electric fence set up by villagers to protect their crops. This is not an isolated incident — over the past five years, more than 30 wild elephants have been killed in Bangladesh, according to conservationists. With their natural habitats shrinking, elephants are increasingly straying into villages in search of food, escalating tensions between locals and the animals. Despite being a protected species under Bangladeshi law, enforcement remains weak, and many killings go unpunished. Without stronger intervention, Bangladesh risks losing one of its most majestic species. The Wildlife (Conservation and Security) Act, 2012: Protects 1,307 species, including elephants, tigers, and river dolphins. Prohibits killing, capturing, or trading protected species, with violators facing fines up to Tk 10 lakh and 12 years of imprisonment. The Animal Welfare Act, 2019: Criminalises cruelty towards all animals, including stray dogs and cats. However, lack of awareness remains a major issue, particularly in rural areas where many do not know that killing protected species is illegal. On 10 May, 2018, a Dhaka court sentenced a man to six months in jail for burying two dogs and 14 puppies alive in Rampura in 2017, under the Cruelty to Animals Act 1920. This case further highlights the importance of enforcing animal protection laws in urban and rural areas alike. Wildlife protection is not only an issue in forests and rural areas — it extends to cities as well. Thousands of stray dogs and cats roam the streets, scavenging for food and shelter. While some communities care for them, many suffer from malnutrition, disease, and abuse. Apart from stray animals, urban spaces in Bangladesh also support a variety of wildlife. Birds such as crows, sparrows, and mynas play a crucial role in seed dispersal and insect control. Lizards, bats, and even snakes help regulate pests, reducing the spread of diseases. However, rapid urbanisation, deforestation, and pollution have led to a sharp decline in their numbers, disrupting the natural balance. Many people view stray animals as a nuisance, not recognising their important role in the ecosystem. As cities expand, construction destroys green spaces, leaving birds and small mammals with fewer places to live and find food. Pollution and waste mismanagement are also major issues, as stray animals and birds often eat plastic or other harmful waste, causing severe health problems. Additionally, traffic hazards pose a huge risk, with many stray animals getting injured or killed in accidents because cities lack proper safety measures for them. On this World Wildlife Day, let's commit to protecting all animals — not just those in forests and rivers, but also those living in our cities. They, too, are part of nature.

67,Tasnuva Islam champions weavers with ethical commerce ,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/tasnuva-islam-champions-weavers-ethical-commerce-3838886,Inspiration behind the initiative A platform rooted in CSR Current situation and challenges Long-term vision A model for others to follow Photo: Courtesy Inspiration behind the initiative A platform rooted in CSR Current situation and challenges Long-term vision A model for others to follow Photo: Courtesy  ,"Since time immemorial, Bangladeshi weavers have honed their craft, producing textiles that carry the weight of history and artistry. Yet, in a rapidly industrialising world, their skills are often overlooked and their voices unheard. Tasnuva Islam, Founder and CEO of The Muslin, and Director of Sales and Marketing at Le ROYAL, Le Méridien Dhaka, saw this reality and chose to act. Her initiative provides weavers with a rare opportunity; a rent-free platform in one of Dhaka's premier hotels, where they can display and sell their creations. This is not charity, but a well-thought-out model of ethical commerce that allows artisans to thrive without the financial constraints that so often suffocate traditional crafts. Tasnuva Islam's inspiration for the initiative traces back to the COVID-19 era when global imports came to a halt. ""During that time, we noticed on platforms like Facebook that local products were gaining traction because there was no alternative due to the lack of imports. That made me think — why not work with weavers, entrepreneurs, and artisans who are interested in showcasing their products through our hotel, or a similar initiative?"" she explains. Her passion for arts and crafts has been a lifelong one, though her engineering background kept her from directly pursuing it. ""I have always been a great admirer of arts and crafts, and I had a knack for designing and crafting. Being an engineering student, I didn't get to do much about it. So, I founded The Muslin and wanted to do something for the weavers. You know, they don't get any platform and earn a very nominal income. I believe that this project was necessary. We don't charge any rent or have any hanger price."" Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) refers to a business's commitment to contributing positively to society, and rather than being purely profit-driven, CSR initiatives integrate ethical considerations into business operations, ensuring that companies give back to the communities they engage with. The hospitality industry rarely intersects with the traditional weaving sector, but Islam has bridged this gap with this innovative CSR project. Under this initiative, Le Méridien Dhaka has opened a dedicated space, where artisans can directly exhibit and sell their handcrafted textiles. Unlike conventional markets, these artisans are not charged any rent, ensuring that they retain the full financial benefit of their work. To sustain the initiative without burdening the artisans, Islam has introduced a nominal VAT, which helps maintain the space and cover staff expenses. This allows the project to remain self-sufficient while keeping the focus on the well-being of the artisans. The initiative is an exemplary model of how corporate resources can be effectively used to support cultural heritage and empower local communities. Despite the positive response, the initiative faces some challenges. ""One challenge we face is that many people are still unaware of our location. Le Méridien, where we are based, is in a relatively quiet part of the city, so people don't always know about us. Despite that, we have seen success,"" says Islam. Another issue is the misconception that the platform is a temporary pop-up event rather than a permanent boutique. To tackle this, Islam and her team are planning to launch a website soon to increase accessibility and awareness. ""Since this is a CSR project, we want to make it more accessible and fairer for all. We have been experiencing a good turnover so far,"" she adds. Looking ahead, Islam has ambitious plans to take Bangladeshi craftsmanship to the global stage. ""Our mid-to-long-term plan is to expand to Europe and America, ensuring that Bangladeshi products, particularly those made by weavers, gain international recognition."" She envisions The Muslin as a gateway for Bangladeshi textiles to compete with Indian and Pakistani products in international markets. ""We aim to create a space where Bangladeshi craftsmanship can compete with Indian and Pakistani products, reaching global markets like New York."" Ultimately, Islam hopes that by taking these strategic steps now, the seeds for long-term success will be firmly planted at the perfect time. The success of this initiative highlights the immense potential of corporate-backed social enterprises. Tasnuva Islam's approach serves as an inspiring model for other businesses looking to integrate CSR into their operations in meaningful ways. Instead of limiting CSR to donations or short-term aid, she has created a sustainable ecosystem where artisans can thrive independently. Other luxury hotels, corporate entities, and even government bodies can take cues from this initiative to support traditional craftspeople in their respective regions. By leveraging existing infrastructure and customer bases, such initiatives can create lasting impacts on local economies and cultural preservation efforts. In a rapidly modernising world, preserving traditional crafts requires more than just passion — it requires strategic action, visionary leadership, and collaborative efforts. With visionaries like Tasnuva Islam at the helm, the future of Bangladeshi weaving traditions looks brighter than ever.   
       Since time immemorial, Bangladeshi weavers have honed their craft, producing textiles that carry the weight of history and artistry. Yet, in a rapidly industrialising world, their skills are often overlooked and their voices unheard. Tasnuva Islam, Founder and CEO of The Muslin, and Director of Sales and Marketing at Le ROYAL, Le Méridien Dhaka, saw this reality and chose to act. Her initiative provides weavers with a rare opportunity; a rent-free platform in one of Dhaka's premier hotels, where they can display and sell their creations. This is not charity, but a well-thought-out model of ethical commerce that allows artisans to thrive without the financial constraints that so often suffocate traditional crafts. Tasnuva Islam's inspiration for the initiative traces back to the COVID-19 era when global imports came to a halt. ""During that time, we noticed on platforms like Facebook that local products were gaining traction because there was no alternative due to the lack of imports. That made me think — why not work with weavers, entrepreneurs, and artisans who are interested in showcasing their products through our hotel, or a similar initiative?"" she explains. Her passion for arts and crafts has been a lifelong one, though her engineering background kept her from directly pursuing it. ""I have always been a great admirer of arts and crafts, and I had a knack for designing and crafting. Being an engineering student, I didn't get to do much about it. So, I founded The Muslin and wanted to do something for the weavers. You know, they don't get any platform and earn a very nominal income. I believe that this project was necessary. We don't charge any rent or have any hanger price."" Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) refers to a business's commitment to contributing positively to society, and rather than being purely profit-driven, CSR initiatives integrate ethical considerations into business operations, ensuring that companies give back to the communities they engage with. The hospitality industry rarely intersects with the traditional weaving sector, but Islam has bridged this gap with this innovative CSR project. Under this initiative, Le Méridien Dhaka has opened a dedicated space, where artisans can directly exhibit and sell their handcrafted textiles. Unlike conventional markets, these artisans are not charged any rent, ensuring that they retain the full financial benefit of their work. To sustain the initiative without burdening the artisans, Islam has introduced a nominal VAT, which helps maintain the space and cover staff expenses. This allows the project to remain self-sufficient while keeping the focus on the well-being of the artisans. The initiative is an exemplary model of how corporate resources can be effectively used to support cultural heritage and empower local communities. Despite the positive response, the initiative faces some challenges. ""One challenge we face is that many people are still unaware of our location. Le Méridien, where we are based, is in a relatively quiet part of the city, so people don't always know about us. Despite that, we have seen success,"" says Islam. Another issue is the misconception that the platform is a temporary pop-up event rather than a permanent boutique. To tackle this, Islam and her team are planning to launch a website soon to increase accessibility and awareness. ""Since this is a CSR project, we want to make it more accessible and fairer for all. We have been experiencing a good turnover so far,"" she adds. Looking ahead, Islam has ambitious plans to take Bangladeshi craftsmanship to the global stage. ""Our mid-to-long-term plan is to expand to Europe and America, ensuring that Bangladeshi products, particularly those made by weavers, gain international recognition."" She envisions The Muslin as a gateway for Bangladeshi textiles to compete with Indian and Pakistani products in international markets. ""We aim to create a space where Bangladeshi craftsmanship can compete with Indian and Pakistani products, reaching global markets like New York."" Ultimately, Islam hopes that by taking these strategic steps now, the seeds for long-term success will be firmly planted at the perfect time. The success of this initiative highlights the immense potential of corporate-backed social enterprises. Tasnuva Islam's approach serves as an inspiring model for other businesses looking to integrate CSR into their operations in meaningful ways. Instead of limiting CSR to donations or short-term aid, she has created a sustainable ecosystem where artisans can thrive independently. Other luxury hotels, corporate entities, and even government bodies can take cues from this initiative to support traditional craftspeople in their respective regions. By leveraging existing infrastructure and customer bases, such initiatives can create lasting impacts on local economies and cultural preservation efforts. In a rapidly modernising world, preserving traditional crafts requires more than just passion — it requires strategic action, visionary leadership, and collaborative efforts. With visionaries like Tasnuva Islam at the helm, the future of Bangladeshi weaving traditions looks brighter than ever.

Work out an hour after iftar, start with light cardio, incorporate yoga for flexibility, and stay hydrated. Complement workouts with green tea to boost metabolism and overall well-being. Photo: Collected / Victor Freitas / Unsplash Exercises help us attain fitness goals, manage weight, and above all, lead a healthy life. So, this Ramadan, it's time we make the right choice for our wellbeing and include exercising with a balanced nutritious diet. Working out in this hot humid environment of ours can be pretty daunting, especially after fasting all day, so we gathered some simple tips for you to follow. Before doing any exercise, the most important thing is to pick the appropriate time. We suggest skipping workouts while fasting as the humid environment will put you at risk of dehydration. Be active throughout the day, whether you are at the office or home, walk a bit if you can, and remember to take rests whenever you are fatigued. The best time for a workout in Ramadan is an hour or two after you have had your iftar, as by then your body would be rehydrated. Before starting your exercise, make sure to warm up and stretch your body properly. Start your session with some cardio; keeping in mind the heat and the fact you have been fasting all day, start lightly. Go for a walk and check how much you can exercise before you are fatigued as the goal is to have easy enough workouts that will help to maintain your fitness throughout the month. Yoga ensures flexibility and strength for both body and mind, making it a nice companion to your fasting journey. Yoga poses — like the bridge, the triangle, and the tree — are great workout options if you are looking for something that will calm your mind and maintain your fitness in the process. As it can be done in the comfort of your home, yoga after an hour or two of iftar might just be the exercising cleanser your body needs. Green tea without sugar, unlike milk tea, plays a key role in weight management. According to nutritionists, green tea contains amino acid which works to improve brain function along with antioxidants like EGCG that help prevent cell damage. Whether it's the pre-workout drink that you need or the post-workout fix, a cup of green tea can be your health and wellness partner along with your workout routine.

Garson, who won best actress for ""Mrs Miniver"" in 1943, had held the record with a five-minutes-and-30-second speech, according to the Guinness World Records website.

74,"Food, Art, and Resilience: ‘Thil’ brings culture, healing to table",https://www.thedailystar.net/my-dhaka/news/food-art-and-resilience-thil-brings-culture-healing-table-3837291, ,"What is hardship food? I had no idea. The thought of what people eat during natural calamities, war, displacement and such, never came to my mind. It is something we do not think about unless we start to live in destitution. I came to realise this, and the profound impact nature bears during difficult times, while walking through Shankhari Bazar with Nahla Tabbaa, a Jordanian Bangladeshi interdisciplinary artist, chef, and curator. Durjoy Bangladesh Foundation (DBF) recently hosted Nahla's culinary performance, a rather unique experience in Dhaka. For Nahla, the grief and anger over the genocide in Gaza left a grave impression, out of which her work, ""Thil"", came into being. ""Thil manifested into a mythical creature that is both our collective shadow and rage over the injustices,"" Nahla says. Thil, the Arabic word for shadow, is an intuitive artistic process and art installation that is iterative. Nahla continues to add contexts and perspectives that plague her mind with each repetition. ""Inside the Belly of the Beast"" is another iteration of Thil, acquired by the Durjoy Bangladesh Foundation (DBF). The artist, in this edition of Thil, undertakes a culinary residency, imagining what the insides of such a powerful beast would taste like, while exploring tensions between the urban and the organic, the beautiful and the grotesque. Nahla is a composed and meditative person by nature, and as a part of her healing, she sought answers in nature, folklore, mythology, and the Quran, exploring seasonal shifts and invasive plants as symbols of resilience, while she conceptualised ""Inside the Belly of the Beast"" and started working on a menu that was leased from meals you have during hard times. ""The results are hybrid foods that have emerged from points across Bangladesh's history through famine, partition, and liberation, and my region is also currently experiencing war and famine. The food also celebrates wild and indigenous plants from both regions, and touches upon dishes that straddle trauma and joy. I deeply feel that nature is a witness to human atrocities,"" Nahla explains. Nahla took inspiration from seasonal greens found in Dhaka and twined them with what edibles she carried with her, and came up with a menu where each course was a revelation. Her spiced ghee candles were a surprise act of talent, as the candle burns, melting the ghee, it turns to a dunk for your shrak bread and zaatar and kishkeh paratha. Her stinging nettle, khubaizeh, helencha shak, kalme shak, soup with alu bhorta gnocchi, gives our alu bhorta a star status. Ilisha polao stuffed vine leaves, chicken paan with pomegranate molasses, marigold and pumpkin flower tempura with dukkah, was indeed a fusion menu between Bangladeshi and Arabian cuisine. ""It has been a learning experience for us at Durjoy Bangladesh Foundation, helping us realise how the Almighty has created nature to support humanity in different, sometimes adverse, conditions. As an art foundation, you may wonder why we're involved in practices beyond the traditional art forms. We like to challenge the boundaries of art, pushing it beyond conventional media and culinary performances and culinary arts, like Thil: Inside the Belly of the Beast, are very much an art form to celebrate,"" says Durjoy Rahman, Founder of Durjoy Bangladesh Foundation. What is hardship food? I had no idea. The thought of what people eat during natural calamities, war, displacement and such, never came to my mind. It is something we do not think about unless we start to live in destitution. I came to realise this, and the profound impact nature bears during difficult times, while walking through Shankhari Bazar with Nahla Tabbaa, a Jordanian Bangladeshi interdisciplinary artist, chef, and curator. Durjoy Bangladesh Foundation (DBF) recently hosted Nahla's culinary performance, a rather unique experience in Dhaka. For Nahla, the grief and anger over the genocide in Gaza left a grave impression, out of which her work, ""Thil"", came into being. ""Thil manifested into a mythical creature that is both our collective shadow and rage over the injustices,"" Nahla says. Thil, the Arabic word for shadow, is an intuitive artistic process and art installation that is iterative. Nahla continues to add contexts and perspectives that plague her mind with each repetition. ""Inside the Belly of the Beast"" is another iteration of Thil, acquired by the Durjoy Bangladesh Foundation (DBF). The artist, in this edition of Thil, undertakes a culinary residency, imagining what the insides of such a powerful beast would taste like, while exploring tensions between the urban and the organic, the beautiful and the grotesque. Nahla is a composed and meditative person by nature, and as a part of her healing, she sought answers in nature, folklore, mythology, and the Quran, exploring seasonal shifts and invasive plants as symbols of resilience, while she conceptualised ""Inside the Belly of the Beast"" and started working on a menu that was leased from meals you have during hard times. ""The results are hybrid foods that have emerged from points across Bangladesh's history through famine, partition, and liberation, and my region is also currently experiencing war and famine. The food also celebrates wild and indigenous plants from both regions, and touches upon dishes that straddle trauma and joy. I deeply feel that nature is a witness to human atrocities,"" Nahla explains. Nahla took inspiration from seasonal greens found in Dhaka and twined them with what edibles she carried with her, and came up with a menu where each course was a revelation. Her spiced ghee candles were a surprise act of talent, as the candle burns, melting the ghee, it turns to a dunk for your shrak bread and zaatar and kishkeh paratha. Her stinging nettle, khubaizeh, helencha shak, kalme shak, soup with alu bhorta gnocchi, gives our alu bhorta a star status. Ilisha polao stuffed vine leaves, chicken paan with pomegranate molasses, marigold and pumpkin flower tempura with dukkah, was indeed a fusion menu between Bangladeshi and Arabian cuisine. ""It has been a learning experience for us at Durjoy Bangladesh Foundation, helping us realise how the Almighty has created nature to support humanity in different, sometimes adverse, conditions. As an art foundation, you may wonder why we're involved in practices beyond the traditional art forms. We like to challenge the boundaries of art, pushing it beyond conventional media and culinary performances and culinary arts, like Thil: Inside the Belly of the Beast, are very much an art form to celebrate,"" says Durjoy Rahman, Founder of Durjoy Bangladesh Foundation. মঙ্গলবার মার্কিন কংগ্রেসে দেওয়া বক্তব্যে জেলেনস্কির কাছ থেকে পাওয়া চিঠি পড়ে শোনান ট্রাম্প।"
75,A different Dhaka in Ramadan,https://www.thedailystar.net/my-dhaka/news/different-dhaka-ramadan-3838151, ,"Have you ever felt the pulse of Dhaka in Ramadan? The way this unforgiving city pauses just before sunset? As if it's holding its breath with the rest of us, then exhaling in unison with the call to prayer? If you're an unlucky officegoer like me, you probably have felt it already. For a whole month, this restless metropolis, always rushing and buzzing, has moved to a different rhythm, adjusting to the fasts of millions. This year, the usual office hours have been set from 9:00am to 3:30pm to make fasting easier. However, the traffic in Dhaka is merciless. The same old fight starts when everyone sets to go home from the office, with thousands of people stuck in traffic, anxiously watching the clock, and silently praying to make it home in time for iftar. And then, just when frustration peaks, the long-awaited thing happens -- the Maghrib call to prayer. For a moment, everything starts feeling a little kinder. People who may never have spoken to each other exchange water and dates. After all, it's the time for iftar. Food packets are passed from one rickshaw puller to another. Traffic cops who were just directing irate crowds now give out water bottles to anyone in the area. People who couldn't make it home in time shows kindness to each other. If you are a silent observer like me, then you may notice suited men in cars sharing their dates with rickshaw pullers. A young woman, caught in the gridlock, accepting a bottle of water from a traffic police officer. A CNG driver and a university student, bound by nothing but the same empty stomach, breaking their fast side by side. It is Dhaka at its finest -- raw, real, and deeply humane. Interestingly, it's not just the streets that change -- markets and bazars take on a whole new rhythm too. As iftar approaches, vendors set up temporary seating on the ground, ready to break their fast right where they work. Those who couldn't manage to buy food are welcome to share a meal with strangers, because during this time, no one eats alone. Mosques that stay quiet for most of the year suddenly overflow with life. Even in residential areas, families set up water filters filled with sharbat or juice outside their homes, making sure that anyone passing by can take a sip and cool down. The whole city moves with a shared spirit of generosity and togetherness during this sunset! The busy junction points, like Bijoy Sharani, Shahbagh, or Dhanmondi 27, magically calm down right before iftar. One minute, it's all honking, yelling, and last-minute lane-cutting -- then silence. The roads empty out like a classroom right after the last bell. It's an odd, almost serene experience! To me, Ramadan in Dhaka is all about these quiet moments between the rush, the softening of the edges, and the collective act of slowing down. But like all beautiful things, Ramadan in Dhaka will go away. The old habits will come back. The honking during the sunsets will return. The jostling, the shoving, the frenzied race against time -- they will all make a comeback. The iftar stalls will disappear, and with them, so will the quiet camaraderie that binds this city together at sunset. And yet, for those of us who have felt it -- the warmth of a stranger's generosity, the silence of a city at peace, the magic of a moment shared -- we carry a flicker of hope. Hope that perhaps, even when Ramadan is gone, we will remember. Remember to pause. Remember to be kind. Remember that Dhaka, even in its chaos, can still come together, if only for a moment, at sunset. Have you ever felt the pulse of Dhaka in Ramadan?

Photo: Courtesy  ","Azra Mahmood, a pioneering figure in Bangladesh’s fashion industry, discusses her journey, evolving trends, and industry challenges. She emphasizes continuous growth, inclusivity, and perseverance, envisioning Bangladesh’s future as a global fashion hub with better management and recognition. Azra Mahmood needs no introduction — she is a trailblazer in the Bangladeshi fashion industry, effortlessly balancing the roles of model, choreographer, mentor, and show director. With a career spanning over two decades, she has not only ruled the runway, but also contributed to reshaping the industry from behind the scenes. As the founder of Azra Mahmood Talent Camp (AMTC), she has nurtured a new generation of models, equipping them with the skills to shine on both national and international platforms. Star Lifestyle caught up with her recently to discuss her journey, the evolution of Bangladesh's fashion scene, and what it truly takes to make it in this ever-changing industry. I've had many roles — model, presenter, choreographer, stylist, mentor, entrepreneur, and show director, even dabbling in acting. But rather than choosing one, I'd say fashion itself defines me. Whether on the runway or behind the scenes, my passion remains constant. It's not about the role — it's about the world of fashion that continues to pull me in. The modelling industry today is far more competitive than it used to be. With new agencies and training schools, at least 100 new models enter the field every month. In such an environment, the only way to sustain and stand out is to keep growing and evolving. A model who doesn't improve, adapt, or refine their craft will eventually fade away. Continuous learning is essential. If a model doesn't work on their skills — be it their walk, expressions, adaptability, or professionalism — they won't last long. So, a successful model is someone who sees the bigger picture, keeps evolving, and is always willing to learn. I started my career in 2001, when Bangladesh's fashion industry was much smaller, with limited designers, models, and events — mostly concentrated in November and December. Now, 24 years later, the industry has expanded significantly, with more retail brands, designers, associations, and fashion weeks, creating greater opportunities. However, proper management remains a challenge. Without a system integrating economics, design, branding, and talent development, sustainable growth is difficult. Additionally, Bangladesh has long been recognised as a manufacturing hub rather than a fashion hub. We focused on ""Made in Bangladesh"" instead of ""Designed in Bangladesh,"" limiting global recognition. While this is slowly changing, there is still a long way to go. Inclusivity in fashion often feels like a token effort — one plus-size or unconventional model doesn't mean true diversity. When I started, fair skin was preferred by many clients, which is absurd, given our country's demographics. Unfortunately, this bias still exists. Beauty is a political construct, shaped by those in power. Historically, different cultures have defined beauty based on their influence — today, Eurocentric features dominate due to Western control. As a mentor and industry professional, I challenge these norms by casting models based on talent, presence, and confidence — not just their skin tone or body type. I also ensure that models understand their value goes beyond societal beauty standards. The industry is slowly changing, but we need more decision-makers to push for true inclusivity. From the very beginning, my goal has been to bring world-class fashion productions to Bangladesh. I remember watching FashionTV (FTV) and being mesmerised by the grandeur of international fashion. I knew that with my height, I might not get to that level as a model, but I could create shows that matched that standard. That dream has driven me for years. I've worked on creating bigger, better productions, making fashion shows more visually compelling, and pushing for professional execution. I believe Bangladesh has the talent, but we need the right platforms to showcase it. I'm not there yet, but I'm close. And as long as there's room for growth, I'll keep pushing. Because the moment things feel stagnant, I lose motivation. Growth is what fuels me. Today's generation wants instant results. They want to achieve success overnight, but true success takes time. If something comes too easily, you don't truly appreciate it, and it doesn't last. The key is to invest in the process, work hard, and stay patient. If you put in the effort, learn the craft, and build your skills over time, your success will be meaningful and sustainable. Also, tolerance is crucial. This industry can be tough. There will be criticism, rejections, and setbacks. But if you stay focused, resilient, and keep moving forward, you will eventually make it. The biggest challenge right now is that many people still don't take fashion seriously. It's seen as something superficial, when in reality, fashion is a major part of daily life. The first thing you do when you leave your house is put on clothes — that's fashion! It's an essential industry, yet it still doesn't get the level of importance or support that it deserves. For real growth, we need proper backing, investment, and industry-wide coordination. Right now, individuals are trying on their own, but we need a collective push. Despite these challenges, I do believe the industry will continue growing. More designers, brands, and platforms are emerging, and as long as people keep innovating and pushing boundaries, Bangladesh will eventually establish itself as a recognised fashion hub.

79,Primary schools barely looked after,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/education/news/primary-schools-barely-looked-after-3724966, ,"A major project to build more classrooms, sanitation facilities and make other improvements in primary schools has not made much progress in six years while the poor environment continues to harm learning and teaching. Two-thirds of the components of the Fourth Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP-4), related to improving the quality of primary education, were unimplemented till May, according to a Planning Commission report. The Tk 38,291 crore project was launched in July 2018. The government in 2022 extended the duration of the project by two years, setting June 2025 as the deadline. But as of September, physical work made only 62 percent progress, said Farid Ahmed, secretary to the primary education ministry. Several project officials said implementation of the project had been almost suspended for the last few months amidst political turmoil. ""It will be next to impossible to complete the project by next June,"" said an official. Meanwhile, classrooms remain overcrowded in hundreds of schools across the country and children spend hours at schools with poor sanitation facilities. Prof Manzoor Ahmed, who is the chief of a government committee to recommend how primary education can be improved, said the delay in the implementation of the project would affect children's learning. The authorities should investigate why the much-needed programme was not implemented, said the professor emeritus and founding director of BRAC University's Institute of Educational Development. Secretary Farid said project implementation had been slow in recent weeks because ""we need some opinions from the Planning Commission and the Economic Relations Division regarding revisions to certain components"". ""We hope everything will be sorted out by this month,"" he said. In 2020 and 2021, the implementation made less than 10 percent progress due to Covid-19 restrictions, he said. The unimplemented components of the PEDP-4 project will be included in PEDP-5, he added. Educationists often say a lack of proper teaching, crowded classrooms, poor student-teacher interaction, and inadequate infrastructure are affecting the quality of primary education. According to the Directorate of Primary Education's latest National Student Assessment published in August 2023, 61 percent of the third graders and 70 percent of the fifth graders do not have the maths proficiency appropriate in their grades. Besides, 51 percent of the third graders and 50 percent of the fifth graders lack competence in Bangla. Of the PEDP-4's Tk 38,291 crore budget, the government is funding Tk 25,561 crore, and development partners are lending Tk 12,730 crore. The objective of the project is to improve the quality of teaching-learning in schools so that students acquire competencies. It also aims to recruit 61,000 teachers, train 1.40 lakh current teachers, build 50,000 classrooms, 10,500 rooms for head teachers, 58,000 WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) blocks with washroom facilities, and renovate 42,000 primary schools. Farid said around 37,000 teachers were appointed last year and the process of appointing another 14,000 was going on. As per a report on the PEDP-4 project, as of May, only 36 percent of the components for quality education were implemented. The implementation rate was 49 percent of the components for access and participation, and 57 percent for management and governance. Rasheda K Choudhury, executive director of Campaign for Popular Education, said ensuring the quality of education is far from what is desired. ""If we do not ensure quality, we will fall behind in fulfilling the desire of elevation to a middle income country. We can make big structures, but there will be a dearth of people to run them,"" she added. The PEDP-4 report by the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division says there were 342 activities under the broader categories of access and participation, quality education, and management and governance. As of May, the implementation of 132 of the activities was yet to start. Of the classrooms, 21,668 are done and 17,192 are being constructed; tenders for building 3,365 head teacher's rooms have been invited, 2,222 contracts signed, 250 constructions are completed, and 1,972 being constructed. Of the WASH blocks, tenders for 50,704 have been invited, 40,071 contracts signed, and 23,172 constructions are done. Secretary Farid said, ""We hope the work will pick up pace in thecoming months."" He added that teachers' training will be prioritised in PEDP-5. A major project to build more classrooms, sanitation facilities and make other improvements in primary schools has not made much progress in six years while the poor environment continues to harm learning and teaching. Two-thirds of the components of the Fourth Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP-4), related to improving the quality of primary education, were unimplemented till May, according to a Planning Commission report. The Tk 38,291 crore project was launched in July 2018. The government in 2022 extended the duration of the project by two years, setting June 2025 as the deadline. But as of September, physical work made only 62 percent progress, said Farid Ahmed, secretary to the primary education ministry. Several project officials said implementation of the project had been almost suspended for the last few months amidst political turmoil. ""It will be next to impossible to complete the project by next June,"" said an official. Meanwhile, classrooms remain overcrowded in hundreds of schools across the country and children spend hours at schools with poor sanitation facilities. Prof Manzoor Ahmed, who is the chief of a government committee to recommend how primary education can be improved, said the delay in the implementation of the project would affect children's learning. The authorities should investigate why the much-needed programme was not implemented, said the professor emeritus and founding director of BRAC University's Institute of Educational Development. Secretary Farid said project implementation had been slow in recent weeks because ""we need some opinions from the Planning Commission and the Economic Relations Division regarding revisions to certain components"". ""We hope everything will be sorted out by this month,"" he said. In 2020 and 2021, the implementation made less than 10 percent progress due to Covid-19 restrictions, he said. The unimplemented components of the PEDP-4 project will be included in PEDP-5, he added. Educationists often say a lack of proper teaching, crowded classrooms, poor student-teacher interaction, and inadequate infrastructure are affecting the quality of primary education. According to the Directorate of Primary Education's latest National Student Assessment published in August 2023, 61 percent of the third graders and 70 percent of the fifth graders do not have the maths proficiency appropriate in their grades. Besides, 51 percent of the third graders and 50 percent of the fifth graders lack competence in Bangla. Of the PEDP-4's Tk 38,291 crore budget, the government is funding Tk 25,561 crore, and development partners are lending Tk 12,730 crore. The objective of the project is to improve the quality of teaching-learning in schools so that students acquire competencies. It also aims to recruit 61,000 teachers, train 1.40 lakh current teachers, build 50,000 classrooms, 10,500 rooms for head teachers, 58,000 WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) blocks with washroom facilities, and renovate 42,000 primary schools. Farid said around 37,000 teachers were appointed last year and the process of appointing another 14,000 was going on. As per a report on the PEDP-4 project, as of May, only 36 percent of the components for quality education were implemented. The implementation rate was 49 percent of the components for access and participation, and 57 percent for management and governance. Rasheda K Choudhury, executive director of Campaign for Popular Education, said ensuring the quality of education is far from what is desired. ""If we do not ensure quality, we will fall behind in fulfilling the desire of elevation to a middle income country. We can make big structures, but there will be a dearth of people to run them,"" she added. The PEDP-4 report by the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division says there were 342 activities under the broader categories of access and participation, quality education, and management and governance. As of May, the implementation of 132 of the activities was yet to start. Of the classrooms, 21,668 are done and 17,192 are being constructed; tenders for building 3,365 head teacher's rooms have been invited, 2,222 contracts signed, 250 constructions are completed, and 1,972 being constructed. Of the WASH blocks, tenders for 50,704 have been invited, 40,071 contracts signed, and 23,172 constructions are done. Secretary Farid said, ""We hope the work will pick up pace in thecoming months."" He added that teachers' training will be prioritised in PEDP-5. মঙ্গলবার মার্কিন কংগ্রেসে দেওয়া বক্তব্যে জেলেনস্কির কাছ থেকে পাওয়া চিঠি পড়ে শোনান ট্রাম্প।"
80,"Age limit for govt job entry: 35yrs for men, 37 for women",https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/age-limit-govt-job-entry-35yrs-men-37-women-3726186, ,"A government committee has recommended raising the maximum age for applying for public service jobs to 35 years for men and 37 years for women. The five-member committee, which was formed to review the feasibility of extending the age limit, submitted its report to the Chief Adviser's Office last week. Yesterday, a highly placed source with knowledge of the matter confirmed the recommendations to The Daily Star. According to the source, the committee recommended 37 as the age limit for women because women often face interruptions in their education or careers due to factors such as marriage and childbearing. The review committee's proposal will be placed before the Advisory Council for the final nod, which sources said was very likely. ""It will be unprecedented in the history of public service if the recommendations are approved,"" said a top official, wishing not to be named. When asked about the committee's recommendations, Adviser Ali Imam Majumder, who is attached to the Chief Adviser's Office, told The Daily Star yesterday that he was not aware of the committee's proposals. He confirmed that the report on this matter has been submitted to Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus. ""I hope that a final decision will be made soon after reviewing it."" Sources in the Cabinet Division mentioned that if the chief adviser was satisfied with the report, he would instruct the Ministry of Public Administration to present it to the Advisory Council. Such policy decisions must be presented in a meeting of the Advisory Council before being finalised. Public administration ministry officials stated that increasing the job entry age would require amending several laws and regulations. They said a meeting with the law ministry would likely take place before the matter was brought to the Advisory Council for discussion to ensure legal clarity. The committee report did not specify whether the age limit change would be temporary or permanent. The source with the knowledge of the report indicated that decisions of this nature needed to be revisited periodically, which was why no specific time frame was mentioned. The current age threshold for all to enter public service is 30. The limit is 32 years for children and grandchildren of freedom fighters. For several years, graduates have been demanding that the government job entry age limit be increased to 35 years. They blocked the Shahbagh intersection during demonstrations on numerous occasions. The protests intensified after the government on September 22 announced that it was not planning to increase the age limit. It formed the review committee on September 30 after hundreds of jobseekers staged a massive demonstration in front of the chief adviser's residence. Led by former caretaker government adviser Abdul Muyeed Chowdhury, the committee considered some key factors, including the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the ""deprivation"" of candidates during the Awami League government's tenure, and economic strains from the Russia-Ukraine war. It also took into account global practices. The committee found that countries like the US have no age limit for government job entry, while Nepal has a limit of 45 years, and some Indian states allow candidates aged up to 36 years. Other members of the committee are Mokhles Ur Rahman, senior secretary to the public administration ministry; Kowsar Zahura, former joint secretary; Muhammad Iqbal, former additional secretary; and Saiful Islam, an incumbent additional secretary. The committee members also looked into the factors behind the demonstrations, said sources. Public service recruitment came to a near halt during the pandemic. Although the previous government announced an age relaxation due to the pandemic, the recruitment process was slow, and fewer new opportunities were created. But before the country got over the pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war affected the national economy and limited job opportunities in public and private sectors, the sources said. They said that numerous students were unable to complete their education because of politically motivated cases and harassment during the tenure of the AL regime. It affected their ability to apply for government jobs. ""The committee considered all these factors to recommend an age increase exceeding the demands of the students,"" said an official. The committee members consulted educators, hiring authorities, and student organisations. It analysed the legal and administrative barriers to making reforms and their possible impact on the labour market and the economy. Recently, Bangladesh Administrative Service Association (BASA) wrote to the cabinet secretary, requesting an increase in the entry and retirement ages for government jobs. A senior official of BASA said if the government accepted these recommendations, it might also increase the retirement age, which is currently 59. The official said government employees typically need to serve at least 25 years to qualify for a pension. Therefore, if the entry age was raised to 35 years, the retirement age would also need to be adjusted accordingly. The source, who has knowledge of the report, said they did not deal with the retirement age limit. However, there is optimism that the government may address both issues simultaneously. Former additional secretary Firoz Mia, a civil service expert, said the government should temporarily increase the age limit to 35 or 37 considering the impacts of the quota system, the pandemic, and political instability. However, raising the age limit permanently could have ""negative"" impact, he added. Increasing the entry age significantly would also necessitate raising the retirement age, he pointed out. Candidates who are 18 years old can seek posts that need educational qualification below Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC). They would have 12 years to get the job. ""Extending this opportunity from 12 to 18–19 years is entirely unnecessary. Additionally, millions apply for government jobs. Increasing the age limit would further swell the number of applicants, making it harder to manage the process in the long run,"" the former bureaucrat said. The government could have considered adjusting the age limit for higher-grade jobs temporarily, such as the next two rounds of the Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) exams, according to him. The recruitment process itself takes at least a year, and in some cases, it can take two to three years. Those who apply at the age of 35 might only be hired at 37 or 38, by which time their enthusiasm for the job may wane, Firoz said. ""I believe that if young people spend too much time pursuing government jobs after graduation, many will lose interest in becoming entrepreneurs. Moreover, starting an entrepreneurial journey after the age of 35 would have its own complexities."" However, the government could permanently raise the age limit to 35, 40, and 42 years for ethnic minorities, the transgender community, and people with disabilities, respectively, Firoz said. A government committee has recommended raising the maximum age for applying for public service jobs to 35 years for men and 37 years for women.

82,"Price hike of essentials: Poor, middle class in a tight corner",https://www.thedailystar.net/health/food/price-essentials/news/price-hike-essentials-poor-middle-class-tight-corner-3725516, ,"Harunur Rashid, a retired government employee, was taken aback by the steep price rise of okra at the capital's Karwan Bazar yesterday. A trader was asking for Tk 110 a kg, a substantial increase from the Tk 70 per kg he paid just a week ago. A month earlier, the price ranged from Tk 40 to Tk 60 per kg. ""I never thought okra would be this expensive. How will people like us manage if vegetable prices keep soaring?"" he questioned. Like okra, the prices of all vegetables have been rising over the last three weeks, causing significant hardship to low- and fixed-income families. The Daily Star yesterday visited the kitchen markets in the capital's Kazipara, Shewrapara, Kochukhet, Ibrahimpur, Farmgate, and Karwan Bazar and found that vegetable prices have surged. Pumpkin was being sold for Tk 70-80 per kg, an increase from Tk 50-60 a week ago, and Tk 35-40 a month back. Pointed gourd was priced at Tk 100-120 per kg, up from Tk 60-70 a week ago, and Tk 50-60 a month earlier. Mushfiq Mia, a rickshaw puller from Paschim Tejkunipara, expressed worries about the soaring vegetable prices. ""Meat and fish have already become too expensive for us. If the vegetables also become unaffordable, what will we eat? How can I support my family?"" he told The Daily Star at the Karwan Bazar kitchen market. Echoing these worries, Jashim Uddin, a private job holder, said his daughter loves tomato curries, but he cannot buy tomatoes for Tk 260 per kg. ""Just three weeks ago, I bought tomatoes for Tk 160 per kg, and last week, they were over Tk 200,"" He alleged that the new government is indifferent to the price hike of vegetables. ""We haven't seen any effective measures from the government, apart from some drives in the kitchen markets. Prices of essentials will not come down unless the government dismantles the traders' syndicates,"" Jashim Uddin said at Karwan Bazar. Traders blamed incessant rain over the last few days and flash floods in some vegetable-growing districts for the price hike. Round aubergine was being sold for Tk 180-200 per kg, a rise from Tk 160-180 just a week ago and Tk 100-140 from a month earlier. Long beans were selling for Tk 120-160 a kg, up from Tk 80-100 last week and Tk 60-80 a month ago. Bitter gourd was priced at Tk 100-120 per kg, compared to Tk 80-100 the previous week and Tk 70-80 a month back. Green papaya costs Tk 50-60 per kg, up from Tk 35-40 a week ago and Tk 25-30 a month earlier. Prices of leafy greens have also increased, with each bundle weighing 250-300 grams sold for at least Tk 30 yesterday, up from Tk 10-20 a month ago. Green chillies was priced at Tk 360-440 per kg yesterday, up from Tk 320-400 a week ago and Tk 240-320 a month earlier. Abu Jafor, a vegetable wholesaler at Karwan Bazar, claimed that incessant rain and flash floods damaged vegetable crops at different parts of the country, contributing to the price hikes. The prices of broiler and Sonali chickens have also gone up, with broiler chicken selling for Tk 200-220 per kg yesterday, up from Tk 180-200 last week and Tk 170-180 a month ago. Sonali chicken is now priced at Tk 280-300 per kg, an increase from Tk 260-280 a week ago and Tk 240-250 a month back. However, egg prices have remained unchanged this week compared to last week. Eggs were being sold for Tk 160-180 per dozen, up from Tk 150-160 a month ago. Hilsa fish has long been out of reach for the ordinary people. Hilsa was being sold for Tk 2,100 per kg (each piece weighing 1 kg), a rise from Tk 1,700 last week and Tk 1,600 a month back. Ghulam Rahman, former president of the Consumers Association of Bangladesh, yesterday said traders attributing the price hike to rain and flash floods was merely an excuse. ""We need to verify whether flash floods have affected the vegetable-growing regions. If not, then it is just an excuse."" He suggested increasing supply and fostering competition among the traders. ""If we can ensure competition among the traders, the prices of essentials will come down,"" he said He urged the government to take necessary measures, including strict market monitoring, to keep the prices of essential affordable.

Speaking at an event marking World Egg Day 2024 at the capital's Krishibid Institution Bangladesh, she said eggs should be available for all citizens, regardless of their income or social background. Blaming syndicates for driving up egg prices, the adviser said that the government is taking measures to address the issue.

General students from the respective campuses made the allegations, for which measures were taken against the 222 physicians and medical students between August 5 and October 2. The allegations include opposing the quota reform movement; threatening students and doctors with an intent to sabotage the movement; participating in Awami League politics; and abusing students and doctors physically and mentally during the student-led mass uprising. ''What is the benefit of expelling a student? Instead, they should be given a chance for correction. If there are serious allegations against anyone, the college authorities should file a case.""  A number of these physicians and students also faced actions for alleged extortion on and around campus, violence, drug trade and use, threats on social media, ragging, and attacks on interns. Of the 86 physicians, 36 are from MAG Osmani Medical College in Sylhet, 17 from Sir Salimullah Medical College in Dhaka, 13 from Mymensingh Medical College, 12 from Sher-e-Bangla Medical College in Barishal, and eight from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical College in Faridpur. Of the 136 medical students, 39 are from M Abdur Rahman Medical College in Dinajpur, 28 from Mymensingh Medical College, 20 from Rajshahi Medical College, 19 from Osmani Medical College, 16 from Rangpur Medical College, 10 from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical College, and four from Sir Salimullah Medical College. The decisions come amid some level of unrest in the health sector after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government. After the August 5 political changeover, many heads and top officials of government healthcare facilities resigned or stopped coming to work, ultimately causing sufferings to patients. The Daily Star has spoken to five directors and principals of as many medical colleges that have taken punitive actions. They said they made the decisions after investigations into the allegations either by the academic council or by the hospital management committee. ""We have taken the measures in response to the allegations of taking a direct stance against the anti-discrimination student movement; providing a list of protesting doctors and students to government agencies; and issuing threats,"" said Dr HM Saiful Islam, director of Sher-e-Bangla Medical College. At Sir Salimullah Medical College, 13 doctors have been declared ""persona non grata"" on the campus while four female students have been expelled from the hall, according to an office order dated August 22, signed by hospital Director Brig Gen Md Majharul Islam Khan. Sher-e-Bangla Medical College has declared six physicians ""persona non grata"" for lifetime, banning them from the campus on several charges. The authorities also suspended six interns for two years. Osmani Medical College authorities have punished 55 physicians and medical students. Of them, 10 are doctors, 11 teachers, 15 interns and 19 students. Six of the 11 teachers have been suspended from all administrative and academic activities. Of the 15 interns, 11 have been suspended for six months to two years. Asked about the justification of the decision, Osmani Medical College Principal Prof Dr Shishir Ranjan Chakraborty said, ''These students and medical professionals took a stance against the anti-discrimination student movement. Disciplinary actions were taken against them following recommendations by the academic council and investigations into the complaints filed by general students.'' Those who have been punished can appeal the decisions, he added. At Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical College in Faridpur, where eight doctors and 10 students have been penalised, the authorities recommended cancellation of the medical certificates of two doctors. Eight of the 10 students have been expelled from their hall. They also cannot take part in academic activities for six months to two years, according to an office order issued on September 2. ""I have been suspended for attending a Chhatra League rally on July 15. That day, no fighting or violence took place. I have been targeted because I supported the Awami League government. Many like me are being victimised for political reasons on flimsy accusations,"" said Rakibul Hasan, a student of Mymensingh Medical College. Rakibul is one of the 28 students suspended by the college authorities. Another 13 interns have been expelled from the dormitories, while 11 of them face suspension of their internship for six months to two years. Speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, an intern doctor of the medical college said he was suspended for two years and declared persona non grata on the campus for his involvement in Awami League politics. Asked about the developments, Prof Nazmul Hossain, director general of Health Education, said Bangladesh's health sector experienced bad governance for over 15 years, and many medical teachers and doctors were complicit. This led to a growing anger among the general students at the medical colleges. ""While the streets of Dhaka were stained with the blood of hundreds of young people, some of our teachers and doctors participated in [Awami League] rallies, which sparked serious anger among the students,"" said Prof Nazmul. There are clear boundaries in government jobs, but these are sometimes crossed due to pressure, temptation, fear, or impulse — none of which is desirable, he said. ""We are trying to solve the issue rationally. In some cases, we've been successful; in other cases, we haven't. But our efforts will continue to restore discipline in medical colleges,"" he said. He added that things have returned to normal in most medical colleges, although some teachers and students who played questionable roles in the past are still on the campuses. ""Those who have committed major wrongs will be punished swiftly, but we should forgive those who have made minor ones."" Public health expert Prof Dr Rashid-E-Mahbub stressed the need for a proper investigation into the allegations against the medical professionals and students. ''We have seen supporters of the previous government being victimised based on old allegations. The allegations that have been raised in this case appear to be political, not academic. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the college authorities to verify whether these allegations are valid within the college context,"" said Prof Rashid, also chairman of the National Committee on Health Rights Movement. ''What is the benefit of expelling a student? Instead, they should be given a chance for correction. If there are serious allegations against anyone, the college authorities should file a case,"" he said. Over the last two months, at least 86 physicians and 136 students in eight public medical colleges and hospitals across the country have faced different punitive actions on various allegations, including ""taking a stance against"" the quota reform movement. The physicians include five professors, three associate professors, two assistant professors and 41 interns, according to the office orders of these institutions. They faced actions like suspension of internship and academic activities for various periods, expulsion from halls, and even recommendations for cancellation of medical certificates. Some have been declared ""persona non grata"" on campus for life.

84,"Is smoking the problem, or that women are doing it?",https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/views/news/smoking-the-problem-or-women-are-doing-it-3839356,Naziba Basher Naziba Basher  ,"A leisurely chat over a cup of tea and a quick smoke hardly has an ominous ring or suggest any associated danger—other than the consumption of tobacco and sugar, of course. Yet, that is exactly what turned out to be a nightmare for two people at a tea stall in Dhaka's Lalmatia area on Saturday. The only reason was that they were women. An elderly man took offence and remarked that women should not be allowed to smoke there, at which the two women were duly offended. An altercation ensued with slurs quickly turning into slaps. In an appalling turn of events, the persecutor, a man well into his 60s, managed to incite a mob, calling the women ""whores"" for  . The mob pounced on the women. They were abused, harassed and assaulted. They were injured and parts of their clothes were ripped off. All because they smoked in public. Taken away into police custody, the two were then told not to file a complaint. When asked about the matter later, Home Affairs Adviser Lt Gen (retd) Jahangir Alam Chowdhury   that smoking in public is an offence—whether the laws against public smoking applied in this case could be a matter of debate—and that people should refrain from this habit. He also remarked that there had been a spat between the women and the old man, and that one of the women had apparently splashed tea on the man, thus triggering the whole incident.   However, the home adviser did not, for once, note the criminal nature of what the men had done to those women. The Penal Code, 1860 in Bangladesh criminalises sexual assault against women, criminal force with intent to dishonour, and attempt of wrongful confinement of women (sections 354, 355 and 375), all of which apply to the mob and the elderly villain in question—all of them men, by the way, and perhaps many smokers among them too. It is not about the consumption of tobacco (chewing zarda, for instance) but the act of smoking by women that is generally associated with Westernised rebelliousness, that almost automatically lends itself to ""bad character."" Women who smoke are frequently labelled as ""wayward,"" implying they lack traditional values. Not for men, though. For them it might be seen as an added layer of appeal—a show of masculinity, even. This double standard is deeply rooted in subcontinental gender norms, cultural expectations, and moral policing, which dictate that women should embody ideals of modesty, virtue, and domesticity. In a justified show of outrage, people protested, many women among them. On Monday, protesters under the banner of ""Bangladesh Against Rape and Oppression""   in front of Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban protesting what happened in Lalmatia, burning an effigy of the home adviser and demanding his resignation. They argued that while smoking in public may be subject to legal restrictions, it does not justify physical assault. They also criticised the adviser for failing to acknowledge the criminal actions perpetrated by the attackers against the two women in Lalmatia. This is not at all about encouraging women—or men—to smoke. Smoking is harmful for both men and women. It increases the risk of lung cancer, other forms of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis, and emphysema, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, strokes, hormonal imbalances, and fertility issues for BOTH male and female smokers. No, it is about the male chauvinistic mindset that sets unreasonable standards for one gender and not the other. The same mindset spills into other spheres of public life—participation in sports, attire or even the nature of employment—with equal toxicity. What happened in Lalmatia and our home adviser's response that followed had nothing to do with smoking. They only proved themselves as two more specimens confirming the stereotype which is easily threatened. It is quite simply discrimination. The same turn of events would have been quite beyond the question if it were two men. It was never about smoking. It is just that women were doing it, and perhaps seen to be invading what is deemed to be men's territory. Feminist movements, urban youth cultures, and changing attitudes are slowly pushing back against these outdated norms, but incidents like the one in Lalmatia show that there is still a long way to go. But we will continue to raise our voice against injustice and gender-based violence. With or without a cigarette between the fingers.

Saiful Alam (not his real name) built his career in the development sector, working in the finance departments of foreign-funded projects in Dhaka for over 15 years.  ","But now, at 47, he faces a harsh reality he never anticipated -- abrupt unemployment. With no other income, he and his family may soon be forced to leave the capital, where his two children are enrolled in a reputed school. He is losing his job as the US Agency for International Development (USAID) has already issued a termination letter for the project he has been working on for the last three years. ""I am currently closing the accounts and preparing final paperwork for submission to the USAID in Washington,"" Saiful told The Daily Star yesterday. ""After that, I'll give myself a month to find another job. If nothing comes up, I'll have no choice but to return to my village."" With more than a decade of experience in development finance, Saiful fears that opportunities in the shrinking sector are scarce.

And why would a private company hire me at a senior level?"" he said. The prospect of relocating to his village is very real. ""It will be extremely difficult for me, my family, and my children to adjust. I have no idea what I will do for a living or where my children will go to school. It's frustrating."" Saiful's plight reflects the broader crisis in the sector. With funding drying up and livelihoods at stake, the future of many in the sector remains uncertain. I don't think I'll find another position in the development sector. And why would a private company hire me at a senior level?  He is just one of tens of thousands of development professionals facing joblessness following USAID's decision to cancel the majority of its nearly 100 projects in Bangladesh. These projects, implemented by around 400 NGOs, have long provided employment to thousands and supported critical development initiatives across the country. Although there is no official data on how many people have lost or may lose their jobs due to the  , people in the sector estimate the number is between 30,000 and 40,000. According to diplomatic sources, USAID annually provides between $300 and $400 million to Bangladesh in the areas of health, nutrition, agriculture, livelihood, labour rights, prevention of human trafficking, and democratic development. However, immediately after the inauguration of Donald Trump as US president on January 20, he ordered suspension of USAID funding and activities funded by the agency globally, except for emergency food supplies including that for the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. All the American personnel of the USAID office in Bangladesh too have been sent on administrative leave. A section of the personnel are working to send papers to the USAID office in Washington DC. Some 10,000 contracts between the USAID and NGOs were terminated on February 25 globally, as the Trump administration decided to eliminate more than 90 percent of foreign aid contracts and cut some $60 billion in funding. Saiful, who has been working for an education project, said they had thought that Trump would cancel projects related to climate change, gender equality and immunisation as his policy does not promote these. ""We were preparing the response to the USAID questions on whether our project is aligned to the current US policy and explain the justification of the project, but received the termination letter before we could send the response... ,"" he said. Another development professional, who was also working for a project related to inclusive finance, said frustration and uncertainty have gripped NGO workers in Bangladesh. It is going to be a challenging time for them, with the USAID terminating projects and the European countries prioritising security funding amid the Trump administration's less interest in supporting Ukraine's war against Russia. An official of a health-related project said, ""Imagine what happens to the poor people benefiting from the projects related to medial support like vaccination."" Noting the termination of more than 1,000 employees by icddr,b following the US decision, he said USAID has also been supporting projects for some essential medicines and birth control materials, which the for-profit companies do not produce. Many poor people benefit from livelihood and income generation-related projects, and they will find themselves in trouble all, the official said. Nazma Akter, executive director at Awaz Foundation, said her organisation had been implementing two US-funded projects, which have been terminated, leaving more than two dozen employees jobless. ""We were working to promote workers' rights, supporting labour-related cases. The US government has always been speaking high on labour rights, but now it has stopped supporting this. It only means that the employers have more opportunities to exploit workers,"" she told The Daily Star. Contacted, NGO Affairs Bureau Director General Anwar Hossain said he has already discussed the issue with a forum of the NGOs that implement USAID-funded projects. ""Joblessness of a significant number of people is indeed a matter of concern. We are asking the NGOs to absorb the jobless people in other projects – as much as they can do,"" he told The Daily Star. Anwar said the bureau was preparing a brief on the impact of the termination of USAID-funded projects for the government. Several development professionals said the government needs to have a fresh look into how the NGO activities can be implemented. A health professional said, ""The government itself should implement many of the work that NGOs now do with foreign funding, like providing essential birth control materials or immunisation."" Abu Eusuf, professor of development studies at the Dhaka University,  said project-based activities are not often sustainable. ""The US decision of terminating funding should be an opportunity for the Bangladesh authorities to learn anew and make themselves self-dependent."" ""We should prioritise creation of jobs, promotion of business and skill building of our youths for both local and global labour markets,"" he said.

","I made the trip alongside a few other Bangladeshi journalists, all of us heading to Lahore to cover the  , and perhaps the final, if India didn't qualify. It was a Saturday, a public holiday in Pakistan, and our journey began early in the morning from Faizabad Bus Station in Islamabad. We boarded a 'Faisal Movers' bus, which, to our surprise, had a large number of vacant seats -- about one-third of the bus was empty. At first, I was taken aback to see that a lady was supervising the bus. For many visitors to Pakistan, the country is often seen through a lens of restriction and conservatism, but this move of appointing female staff, particularly in all their bus services, showed a side of Pakistan's social progress that may not always be obvious to outsiders. As we settled into our seats, I realised that this was no ordinary bus ride. The business-class seats on Faisal Movers offered built-in massage functions, a luxury that most people would not expect on a bus. But that wasn't all. The bus came equipped with modern entertainment options, including Wi-Fi, movies, music, and e-books, creating a travel experience that felt closer to an airline flight than anything on the road. Snacks were served later in the journey, adding to the comfort and indulgence of the trip. In fact, the experience was described by some as ""A touch of flight experience on roads,"" a slogan that Faisal Movers had clearly taken to heart. But it wasn't just the luxury that made this trip stand out -- it was the journey itself. The M-2 motorway, with its smooth six-lane road and picturesque surroundings, is a sight to behold. The drive through the open spaces, rolling hills, and breathtaking views on either side of the motorway made the ride feel like an exploration of Pakistan's natural beauty. With its wide, well-maintained lanes, the motorway gave me a sense of traveling on roads akin to those in Europe or America, a refreshing change from the usual chaotic traffic one might expect elsewhere. Two hours into the journey, as we approached the Salt Range, a region famous for its extensive rock salt deposits, the atmosphere shifted. The bus made an unexpected stop near Kallar Kahar, a place where the journey would take a dangerous turn. I learned from local passengers that this area was notorious for accidents, and for good reason. A police protocol was in place, and all buses would be escorted through this 10-kilometre stretch by a police convoy. The reason for this caution was starkly evident. Two years ago, two separate bus accidents in this very region had claimed the lives of at least 25 people, with 80 more injured. The cause of these tragic accidents was reported to be tyre bursts while overtaking on the motorway. Since then, it had become customary for bus companies to follow strict safety measures during this passage. The buses had to limit their speed to just 40 km/h through this dangerous section of the motorway, making the once smooth ride take on a new, more thrilling edge. The police escort gave us a sense of security as we navigated this challenging stretch, and soon, we were back on track, resuming the journey at speeds of up to 100 km/h. Though the comfort of the bus made it easy to drift off to sleep, the excitement of the experience and the awe-inspiring views outside kept me alert and engaged throughout the ride. What began as a leisurely ride turned into an experience that balanced luxury with moments of heart-pounding anticipation. In the end, this five-hour journey from Islamabad to Lahore was not just a trip from one city to another -- it was an adventure. With its unmatched level of comfort, the stunning beauty of the M-2 motorway, and the thrill of navigating the Salt Range, this bus ride was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, made even more memorable by the impeccable service of Faisal Movers. For anyone traveling between these two iconic cities, this journey offers more than just a means of transportation -- it offers an experience that blends luxury with excitement, a true taste of what travel can be when you least expect it.
